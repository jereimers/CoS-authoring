# Heart of Sorrow

## Description
The **Heart of Sorrow** is a giant crystal heart hidden inside [[Castle Ravenloft]], serving as a powerful defensive mechanism for [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich]]. This massive, pulsing crystal absorbs damage that would otherwise harm the vampire lord, allowing him to fight with terrifying boldness.

The heart is located in **area K20** of Castle Ravenloft.

## Properties
- **Type:** Artifact / Magical Object
- **Hit Points:** 50
- **Regeneration:** Restored to 50 hit points each dawn (if it has at least 1 HP remaining)
- **Rarity:** Artifact (unique)
- **Attunement:** N/A (connected to Strahd)

## Damage Absorption
Any damage that [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich]] takes is transferred to the Heart of Sorrow instead. This includes all types of damage from any source.

- If the Heart absorbs damage that reduces it to 0 hit points, it is **destroyed**, and Strahd takes any leftover damage
- The Heart restores to 50 hit points each dawn, provided it has at least 1 hit point remaining
- As a **bonus action**, Strahd can break his link to the Heart so it no longer absorbs damage dealt to him
- Strahd can reestablish his link to the Heart as a **bonus action**, but only while in Castle Ravenloft

## Visual Effects
The protection afforded by the Heart of Sorrow can be chilling to behold. Damage to Strahd is quickly undone—for example, a critical hit might dislocate Strahd's jaw, but only for a moment before the vampire's jaw quickly resets itself.

## Antimagic Vulnerability
The Heart of Sorrow's ability to absorb damage is **suppressed** if it or Strahd is fully within an *antimagic field*.

## Notes
- Destroying the Heart of Sorrow is a crucial strategic objective before facing Strahd
- The Heart provides Strahd with an additional 50 effective hit points that regenerate daily
- Players should be encouraged to discover and destroy this artifact before the final battle
- Located in Castle Ravenloft, area K20
- The visual effect of Strahd's wounds rapidly healing can be demoralizing for players who don't know about the Heart
