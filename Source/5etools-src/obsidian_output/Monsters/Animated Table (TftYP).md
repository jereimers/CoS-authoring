## Traits

**Antimagic Susceptibility.** The table is [[incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the table must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**False Appearance.** While the table remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal table.

**Charge.** If the table moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (**2d8**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].


## Actions

**Ram.** Melee Weapon Attack +6, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.
