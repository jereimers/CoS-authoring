# Incendiary Cloud

*8th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

A swirling cloud of embers and smoke fills a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range. The cloud's area is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]]. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by [[Gust of Wind|XPHB]]) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **10d8** Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] moves into its space and when it enters the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.
