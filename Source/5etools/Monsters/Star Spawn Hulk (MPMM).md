## Traits

**Psychic Mirror.** If the hulk takes psychic damage, each creature within 10 feet of the hulk takes that damage instead; the hulk takes none of the damage. In addition, the hulk's thoughts and location can't be discerned by magic.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hulk makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target also takes 9 (**2d8**) psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of the target's next turn.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Reaping Arms {@recharge 5}.** The hulk makes a separate Slam attack against each creature within 10 feet of it. Each creature that is hit must also succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
