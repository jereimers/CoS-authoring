# Javelin of Lightning

*Item, Uncommon*

Each time you make an attack roll with this magic weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.

## Lightning Bolt

When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking **4d6** Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
