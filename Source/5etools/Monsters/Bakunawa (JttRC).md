## Traits

**Amphibious.** The bakunawa can breathe air and water.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the bakunawa fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The bakunawa makes one Bite attack and one Storm Slam attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) lightning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the bakunawa. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], and it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the bakunawa. At the start of each of the bakunawa's turns, each swallowed creature takes 10 (**3d6**) lightning damage.

The bakunawa's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the bakunawa takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the bakunawa must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 15 feet of the bakunawa. If the bakunawa dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Storm Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (**1d10**) thunder damage, and the target is pushed up to 10 feet in a horizontal direction away from the bakunawa.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Nimble Glide.** The bakunawa flies or swims up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Slam.** The bakunawa makes one Storm Slam attack.

**Lightning Strikes (Costs 3 Actions).** The bakunawa arcs lightning at up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (**4d10**) lightning damage.
