## Traits

**Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the shadowghast must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to this Stench for 24 hours.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the shadowghast can take the Hide action as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The shadowghast makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h11 (**2d8 + 2**) slashing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) necrotic damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
