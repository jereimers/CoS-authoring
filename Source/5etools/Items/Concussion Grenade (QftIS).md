# Concussion Grenade

*Item, None*

{#itemEntry Grenade|DMG}

This grenade explodes in a concussive blast that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking (**6d6**) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
