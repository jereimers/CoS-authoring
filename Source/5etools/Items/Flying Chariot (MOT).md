# Flying Chariot

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

The chariot's riders and creatures pulling the chariot gain a +1 bonus to their AC.

If this magic chariot is pulled by one or more flying creatures, it too can fly.

> **Chariots**
> 
> Chariots and the creatures pulling them work like controlled mounts, as described in the mounted combat rules in the [[Player's Handbook|PHB]], but with the following differences:
> 
> - Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed.
> - Being mounted on a chariot grants you Cover.
> - A chariot's speed is equal to the speed of the slowest creature pulling it.
> - If multiple creatures are pulling the chariot, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.
