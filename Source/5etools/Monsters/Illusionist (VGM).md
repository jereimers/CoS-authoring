## Traits

**Displacement (Recharges after the Illusionist Casts an Illusion Spell of 1st Level or Higher).** As a bonus action, the illusionist projects an illusion that makes the illusionist appear to be standing in a place a few inches from its actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against the illusionist. The effect ends if the illusionist takes damage, it is [[incapacitated]], or its speed becomes 0.


## Actions

**Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h2 (**1d6 - 1**) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (**1d8 - 1**) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
