# Basic Poison

*Item, None*

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can use a vial of Basic Poison to coat one weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from the poisoned weapon or ammunition takes an extra **1d4** Poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute or until its damage is dealt, whichever comes first.
