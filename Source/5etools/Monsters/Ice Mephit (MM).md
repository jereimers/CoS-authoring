## Traits

**Death Burst.** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of jagged ice. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (**1d8**) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**False Appearance.** While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary shard of ice.


## Actions

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) slashing damage plus 2 (**1d4**) cold damage.

**Frost Breath {@recharge}.** The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of cold air. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (**2d4**) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
