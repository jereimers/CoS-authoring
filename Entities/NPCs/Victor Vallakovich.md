## #Character_Information
### ***Persona.*** 
To the world, Victor is a quiet, moody, and isolated young man with an awkward manner and a total lack of social graces. To those he trusts, Victor is a devoted and compassionate friend, with a spark of brilliance and the stubbornness of a mule. Only Victor knows that he secretly fears losing Stella’s friendship—both due to the harm caused by his *teleportation circle* and due to the time she’s spent with Erasmus van Richten in the Ethereal Plane.

### ***Morale.*** 
In a fight, Victor would attempt to flee, but would resort to his most dangerous spells with wanton and amateurish abandon if cornered or if defending his friends or family.

### ***Relationships.*** 
Victor is the only child of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] and Baroness Lydia Petrovna. He is a close friend to Stella Wachter, and a friendly (though wary) acquaintance to the ghost of Erasmus van Richten. Victor despises and fears [[Izek Strazni]], who killed Victor’s childhood cat, Murka, by kicking it across a room when it wandered into his path two years ago. (Victor has since reanimated Murka’s skeleton through the use of his *animate dead* spell.)

### ***Knowledge***
If persuaded to aid the players in finding [[Arabelle]], Victor can share the following information:

* Three years ago, he found an old spellbook in his father’s library. He’s used it to study magic ever since.
* The original owner of the spellbook was a mage named [[Khazan]]. The symbol on the cover of the spellbook was his personal sigil.
* Long ago, Khazan built a wizard’s tower, which he imbued with powerful enchantments, including a protective field that prevented any other spellcasters from using magic within its reach.

If the players agree to investigate Khazan’s tower and give Victor any artifacts they find, he tells them where the tower can be found: a gravel causeway on Lake Baratok, to the west. 

If asked about the different factions and locations throughout Barovia, Victor can provide the following information:

- **_The Amber Temple._** Victor flips through his spellbook, then shares that, according to its pages, Khazan once sought out the secrets of power at a temple "forged of amber." "According to his notes, it was previously guarded by an order of knights in the service of a dragon," he adds curiously. "But when Strahd conquered the valley, he slaughtered them all."
