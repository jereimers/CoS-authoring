## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.

**Grasping Tendrils.** The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it.

**Spider Climb.** The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h22 (**4d8 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Tendril.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one creature. @hThe target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]] and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper can't use the same tendril on another target.

**Reel.** The roper pulls each creature [[grappled]] by it up to 25 feet straight toward it.
