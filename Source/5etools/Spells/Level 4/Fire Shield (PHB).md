# Fire Shield

*4th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

---

Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes **2d8** fire damage from a warm shield, or **2d8** cold damage from a cold shield.
