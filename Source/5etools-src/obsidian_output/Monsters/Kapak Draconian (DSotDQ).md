## Traits

**Death Throes.** When the draconian is reduced to 0 hit points, it dissolves into acid that splashes on those around it. Each creature within 5 feet of the draconian must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for 1 minute. A creature covered in the acid takes 7 (**2d6**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature.

**Glide.** When the draconian falls and isn't [[incapacitated]], it subtracts up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating the fall's damage, and it can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The draconian makes two Dagger attacks. If both attacks hit the same creature, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] until the end of the target's next turn. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target is also [[paralyzed]].

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) poison damage.
