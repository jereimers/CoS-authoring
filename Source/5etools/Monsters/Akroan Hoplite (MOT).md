## Traits

**Hold the Line.** While the hoplite is holding a spear, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from the hoplite when they move within 5 feet of it. When the hoplite hits a creature with an opportunity attack using its spear, the creature takes an extra 4 (**1d8**) piercing damage, and the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hoplite makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage, or 7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Shield Bash.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
