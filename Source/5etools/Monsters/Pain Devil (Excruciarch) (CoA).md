## Traits

**Aura of Torment.** Any creature hostile to the excruciarch that starts its turn within 20 feet of the excruciarch takes 10 (**4d4**) slashing damage, unless the excruciarch is [[incapacitated]].

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the excruciarch's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance.** The excruciarch has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sadism.** The excruciarch gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for each creature it damaged on its previous turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The excruciarch makes two Scourge attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with Storm of Steel (if available).

**Scourge.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (**2d8 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Storm of Steel {@recharge 4}.** The excruciarch swings its scourge wildly around itself. All creatures within 15 feet of the excruciarch must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Targets take 31 (**6d8 + 4**) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Vulnerable Gaze.** As a reaction to a creature resisting damage dealt by the excruciarch, it turns its gaze on that creature, negating any resistances and immunities that creature has until the start of the excruciarch's next turn.
