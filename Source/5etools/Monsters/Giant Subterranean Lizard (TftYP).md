## Actions

**Multiattack.** The lizard makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. One attack can be replaced by Swallow.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the lizard can't bite another target.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target not grappled by the lizard. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Swallow.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature the lizard is grappling. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage. The target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the lizard, and it takes 10 (**3d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the lizard's turns. The lizard can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the lizard dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
