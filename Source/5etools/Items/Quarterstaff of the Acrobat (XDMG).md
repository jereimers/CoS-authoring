# Quarterstaff of the Acrobat

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

While holding this weapon, you can cause it to emit green [[Dim Light|XPHB]] out to 10 feet, either as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] or after you roll [[Initiative|XPHB]], or you can extinguish the light as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]].

While holding this weapon, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.

## Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only)

While holding this weapon, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) checks.

## Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only)

When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your [[Armor Class|XPHB]] against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't use this property again until you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only)

This weapon has T with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.
