## Traits

**Fortitude (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If damage reduces Irvan to 0 hit points, he can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken. On a successful save, Irvan drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Special Equipment.** Irvan wears [[gloves of swimming and climbing]] and wields a ruidium shortsword (see appendix B). If Irvan rolls a 1 on an attack roll made with the shortsword, he must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]].

In addition, Irvan has a magical prosthetic arm. While the arm is attached to him, it functions the same as the body part it is replacing. Irvan can attach or detach the arm as an action, and it can't be removed by anyone else.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Irvan makes one Dagger attack and two Ruidium Shortsword attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d4 + 5**) piercing damage plus 17 (**5d6**) poison damage.

**Ruidium Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) psychic damage.
