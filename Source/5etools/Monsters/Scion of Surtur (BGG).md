## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (6/Day).** If the scion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The scion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The scion deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The scion makes one attack using Lava Blade or Lava Ball, as well as two Slam attacks.

**Lava Blade.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h32 (**4d10 + 10**) slashing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) fire damage.

**Lava Ball.** Ranged Weapon Attack +18 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. @h29 (**3d12 + 10**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 26 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d8 + 10**) force damage.

**Lava Wave {@recharge 5}.** The scion emits a wave of lava from its blade, hands, or mouth in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 60 (**11d10**) fire damage and has the [[restrained]] condition from being embedded in hardening rock. A creature can make a DC 25 Strength ([[Athletics]]) check as an action, freeing itself or a creature within reach from the rock on a success. The rock has AC 17 and 40 hit points, and it is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.


## Bonus Actions

**Earth-Shaking Movement.** The scion moves up to its speed and then sends a shock wave through the ground in a 60-foot-radius circle centered on itself. Each creature on the ground in that area that is [[concentration]] must succeed on a DC 26 Constitution saving throw or lose [[concentration]].

**Incendiary Smoke.** The scion causes smoke and white-hot embers to billow from its skin, filling a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself that moves with it. While the scion's skin billows smoke, ranged attacks against the scion are made with disadvantage. A creature that moves into the smoke for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) fire damage. The scion's skin stops billowing smoke after 1 minute, when the scion dies, or when the scion uses this bonus action to stop the smoke.
