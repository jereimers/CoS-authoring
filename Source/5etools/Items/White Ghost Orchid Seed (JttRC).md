# White Ghost Orchid Seed

*Item, None*

More rarely, the orchids produce a smaller pod holding a single white seed. Among its various magical properties, if a white seed is ground and scattered over a dead body, the body is affected by the [[resurrection]] spell. A white ghost orchid seed has no effect if consumed.
