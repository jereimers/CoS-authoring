## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hunter makes three attacks, using Shortsword or Longbow in any combination.

**Shortsword.** m +7, reach 5 ft. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) Piercing damage, and the target has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

**Longbow.** r +7, range 150/600 ft. @h17 (**3d8 + 4**) Piercing damage, and the target's [[Speed|XPHB]] is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Mark of Tharashk.** The hunter magically marks one creature it can see within 150 feet. The mark lasts for 1 hour, until the target dies, or until the hunter uses this [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] again. While the target is marked in this way, the hunter has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against the target, and the target gains no benefit from the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition against the hunter.


## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** @actTrigger The hunter is hit by an attack roll. @actResponse The hunter halves the damage (round down) it takes from that attack.
