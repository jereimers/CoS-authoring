**Flyby.** The comet doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Illumination.** The comet sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

**Siege Monster.** The comet deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Unusual Nature.** The comet doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The comet makes one Slam attack and one Spit Fire attack.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (**2d6**) fire damage.

**Spit Fire.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d10 + 2**) fire damage.
