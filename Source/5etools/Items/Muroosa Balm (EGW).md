# Muroosa Balm

*Item, None*

This paste made from the muroosa bush is known to help prevent sunburn, but it is also a fire retardant. After spending 1 minute applying a quarter pint of muroosa balm to your skin, you gain resistance against fire damage for 1 hour.

A dose of muroosa balm sufficient for treating sunburn costs 1 gp.
