# Cloak of Elvenkind

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
