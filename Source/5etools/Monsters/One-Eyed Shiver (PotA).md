## Traits

**Chilling Mist.** While it is alive, the one-eyed shiver projects an aura of cold mist within 10 feet of itself. If the one-eyed shiver deals damage to a creature in this area, the creature also takes 5 (**1d10**) cold damage.


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Eye of Frost.** The one-eyed shiver casts [[ray of frost]] from its missing eye. If it hits, the target is also [[restrained]]. A target [[restrained]] in this way can end the condition by using an action, succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.
