## Traits

**Aberrant Form.** The zealot exudes the chaos of the Far Realm. Any non-Aberration creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the zealot must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) psychic damage.

**Weirdly Pliable.** The zealot, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, is unnaturally flexible. The zealot can move through any space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The zealot makes one Psychic Rend attack and two Shortsword attacks.

**Psychic Rend.** Attack (ms,rs) +7 to hit, reach 15 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the start of the zealot's next turn.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) psychic damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Void Warp {@recharge 5}.** The zealot teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 120 feet of itself, leaving a churning void in the space it left. Immediately after it teleports, each creature within 30 feet of the void other than the zealot must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (**4d8**) force damage and is pulled to the unoccupied space closest to the void. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. The void then disappears.
