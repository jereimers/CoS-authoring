## Traits

**Blood Frenzy.** The wave shaper has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

**Limited Amphibiousness.** The wave shaper can breathe air and water, but it needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.

**Shark Telepathy.** The wave shaper can magically command any shark within 120 feet of it, using a limited telepathy.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wave shaper makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d8 + 1**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) cold damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d8 + 1**) slashing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) cold damage.

**Whirlpool (1/Day).** The wave shaper targets a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep, causing a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, 25 feet tall, and lasts for 1 minute or until the wave shaper is [[incapacitated]]. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength ([[Athletics]]) check.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (**2d8**) bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until it ends. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but it has disadvantage on the Strength ([[Athletics]]) check to do so.

The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 9 (**2d8**) bludgeoning damage. This damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.
