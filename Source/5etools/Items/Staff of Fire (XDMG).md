# Staff of Fire

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

You have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Fire damage while you hold this staff.

## Spells

The staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

| Spell | Charge Cost |
|---|---|
| [[Burning Hands|XPHB]] | 1 |
| [[Fireball|XPHB]] | 3 |
| [[Wall of Fire|XPHB]] | 4 |

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the staff crumbles into cinders and is destroyed.
