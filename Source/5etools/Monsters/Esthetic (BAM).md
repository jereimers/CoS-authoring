## Traits

**Bioluminescence.** While it has at least 1 hit point, the esthetic sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and its interior compartments are dimly lit.

**Spelljamming.** The esthetic has the properties of a spelljamming helm (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide), but only its reigar creator can attune to it.

**Unusual Nature.** The esthetic doesn't require air, food, or drink.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The esthetic makes two Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d6 + 7**) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the creature takes 18 (**4d8**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns, and the esthetic can't use this tentacle against other targets. The esthetic has `1d4 × 2` tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.


## Bonus Actions

**Jammerscream {@recharge}.** The esthetic targets one spelljamming ship within 300 feet of itself, magically suppressing the properties of the ship's spelljamming helm for `2d10` days. If the ship has more than one helm aboard it, randomly determine which helm is affected. A creature attuned to that helm can choose to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 42 (**12d6**) psychic damage, and the helm is suppressed for `2d10` hours instead of `2d10` days. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and the helm is suppressed for `2d10` minutes instead of `2d10` days.
