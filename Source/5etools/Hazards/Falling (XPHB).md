# Falling

A creature that falls takes **1d6** Bludgeoning damage at the end of the fall for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of **20d6**. When the creature lands, it has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition unless it avoids taking any damage from the fall.

A creature that falls into water or another liquid can use its [[Reaction|XPHB]] to make a DC 15 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) check to hit the surface head or feet first. On a successful check, any damage resulting from the fall is halved.
