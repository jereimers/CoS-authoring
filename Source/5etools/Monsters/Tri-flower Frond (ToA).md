## Actions

**Multiattack.** The tri-flower frond uses its orange blossom, then its yellow blossom, and then its red blossom.

**Orange Blossom.** The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target is [[unconscious]]. At the end of each minute, the [[poisoned]] target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Yellow Blossom.** The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, or it is covered with corrosive sap and takes 5 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. Dousing the target with water reduces the acid damage by 1 point per pint or flask of water used.

**Red Blossom.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h2 (**1d4**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target takes 5 (**2d4**) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The red blossom can grapple only one target at a time. Another creature within reach of the tri-flower frond can use its action to end the grapple on the target.
