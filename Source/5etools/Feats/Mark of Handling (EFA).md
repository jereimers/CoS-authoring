# Mark of Handling

You gain the following benefits.

## Wild Intuition

When you make an Intelligence ([[Nature|XPHB]]) or Wisdom ([[Animal Handling|XPHB]]) check, you can roll `1d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

## Primal Connection

You always have the [[Animal Friendship|XPHB]] and [[Speak with Animals|XPHB]] spells prepared. You can cast each spell once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this feat).

## Monstrous Connections

When you reach character level 3, you can target a Monstrosity when you cast [[Animal Friendship|XPHB]] or [[Speak with Animals|XPHB]] if the creature's Intelligence score is 3 or lower.

## Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Handling Spells table are added to that feature's spell list.
