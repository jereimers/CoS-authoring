## Traits

**False Appearance.** If Squirt is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed Squirt move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that Squirt is animate.

**Unusual Nature.** Squirt doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Boggle Oil (3 Applications).** Squirt expends 1 application of boggle oil to create a 10-foot-square puddle of slippery, non-flammable oil on the ground within 5 feet of it. The puddle is difficult terrain and lasts for 1 hour. Each creature that enters the puddle's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or fall [[prone]]. Boggles are unaffected by the oil. After it expends all 3 applications, Squirt can't use this action again until its supply of boggle oil is replenished.
