# Rod of Rulership

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition for 8 hours. While [[Charmed|XPHB]] in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your allies or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be [[Charmed|XPHB]] in this way. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
