## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Ringlerun wields a [[staff of power]]. It has 20 charges when fully charged and regains `2d8 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses its other properties; on a 20, it regains `1d8 + 2` charges.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ringlerun makes three [[staff of power]] or Freezing Ray attacks. He can replace one of those attacks with a use of Spellcasting.

**Staff of Power.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) bludgeoning damage, or 5 (**1d8 + 1**) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands, and Ringlerun can expend 1 of the staff's charges to deal an extra 3 (**1d6**) force damage.

**Freezing Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h27 (**6d8**) cold damage.

**Staff Spell.** While holding his [[staff of power]], Ringlerun can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 14, +8 to hit with spell attacks): cone of cold (**8d8** cold damage; 5 charges), fireball (**10d6** fire damage; 5 charges), globe of invulnerability (6 charges), hold monster (5 charges), levitate (2 charges), lightning bolt (**10d6** lightning damage; 5 charges), magic missile (1 charge), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or wall of force (5 charges).
