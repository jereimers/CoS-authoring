# X17. Upper West Hall

The walls of this twenty-foot-wide, seventy-foot-long arched corridor are sheathed in amber. The southern half of the hall is scorched by fire, and a charred corpse lies on the floor here, under a burned fur cloak. Several amber doors lead from this hall, and three arrow slits are cut into the east wall. Floating in the middle of the hall are three skulls wreathed in green flame.

Three flameskulls guard this hall, attacking creatures that enter. The flameskulls will not leave the hall.
The charred corpse is all that remains of a wizard named Jakarion, who came to the Amber Temple seeking power. The flameskulls incinerated the wizard.

The arrow slits look down on the temple (area X5).

## Treasure

Although the dead wizard's spellbook didn't survive, his staff did. It is a staff of frost. Imprinted on it is a fragment of the wizard's personality. The first character who touches the staff gains the following flaw: "I crave power above all else, and will do anything to obtain more of it." This flaw trumps any conflicting personality trait.
