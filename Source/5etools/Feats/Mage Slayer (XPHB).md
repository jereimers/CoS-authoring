# Mage Slayer

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Concentration Breaker

When you damage a creature that is [[Concentration]], it has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on the saving throw it makes to maintain [[Concentration]].

## Guarded Mind

If you fail an Intelligence, a Wisdom, or a Charisma saving throw, you can cause yourself to succeed instead. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
