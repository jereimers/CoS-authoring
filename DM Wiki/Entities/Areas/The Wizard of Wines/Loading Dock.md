# W2. Loading Dock

Parked in the loading dock is a wagon with three barrels set in braces on the bed. A raised wooden walkway runs along the west, south, and east walls. Through a hole in the ceiling you see the wooden arm of a loading crane with ropes and hooks dangling from it.

Wine barrels in the cellar (area W14) are rolled up a ramp (area W12) to the crane on the upper floor (area W16), then lowered into the wagon from above. Empty barrels are rolled off the back of the wagon and stored in area W9. The three barrels on the wagon hold Purple Grapemash No. 3.

The south door has been forced open and hangs ajar. It can't be closed properly until repaired, though it can be barricaded.
