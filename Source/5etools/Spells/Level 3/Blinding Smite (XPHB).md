# Blinding Smite

*3rd-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus (which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Melee weapon or an {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB})  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 minute

---

The target hit by the strike takes an extra **3d8** Radiant damage from the attack, and the target has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the [[Blinded|XPHB]] target makes a Constitution saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The extra damage increases by `3d8` for each spell slot level above 3.
