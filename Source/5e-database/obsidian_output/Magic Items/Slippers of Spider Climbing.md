# Slippers of Spider Climbing

*Wondrous Items, Uncommon*

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
