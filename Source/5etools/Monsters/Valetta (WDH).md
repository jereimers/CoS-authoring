## Traits

**Divine Eminence.** As a bonus action, Valetta can expend a spell slot to cause her melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (**3d6**) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If Valetta expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by **1d6** for each level above 1st.


## Actions

**Breathe Weapon.** Valetta can use her action to exhale a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot line of lightning (but can't do this again until she finishes a short or long rest); each creature in the line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking **2d6** lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage.
