# Mechanical Wonder (Flying)

*Wondrous Item, Common*

A Mechanical Wonder is a semi-autonomous object imbued with magical power. Mechanical Wonders vary greatly in size and form depending on their function.

A Mechanical Wonder is a dormant object until activated. To activate a Mechanical Wonder, you must wind the wonder with a handheld key unique to that wonder. It takes 1 minute to wind a Mechanical Wonder. While you wind it, you must take the [[Utilize|XPHB]] action each turn.

Once wound, a Mechanical Wonder remains activated for the duration specified in the wonder's description.

An activated flying wonder uses the [[Flying Wonder|FRAiF]] stat block. The wonder is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the wonder shares your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[Dodge|XPHB]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger. The flying wonder is destroyed if it drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].
