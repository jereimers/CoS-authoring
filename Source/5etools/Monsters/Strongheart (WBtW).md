## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Strongheart wields [[Steel|WBtW]], a sentient, lawful good longsword (see appendix A).


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Strongheart makes three Steel attacks.

**Steel.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage when used with two hands. Once on each of his turns, Strongheart can also cause the blade to gleam with holy light. If he does so, the target is [[blinded]] until the start of Strongheart's next turn.

**Revivify (Recharges at the Next Dawn).** While holding Steel, Strongheart casts [[revivify]].



## Reactions

**Protect Another.** When a creature Strongheart can see attacks another creature that is within 5 feet of him, Strongheart can use his reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, provided he is carrying a shield.
