# Aarakocra

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** walk 30 ft., fly (equal to walking)  

## Flight

Because of your wings, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can't use this flying speed if you're wearing medium or heavy armor.

## Talons

You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals **1d6** + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

## Wind Caller

Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[gust of wind]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for when you cast [[gust of wind]] with this trait (choose when you select this race).
