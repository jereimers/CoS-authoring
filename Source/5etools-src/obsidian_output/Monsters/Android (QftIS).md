## Traits

**Design Specialization.** When the android is created, it gains one of six possible designs suited for its role (choose or roll a `d6`): 1, aerialist; 2, diplomat; 3, diver; 4, duelist; 5, medic; 6, sentry. This design determines certain traits in this stat block.

**Lightning Overload.** When the android takes lightning damage, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the start of its next turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The android makes two Force Strike attacks.

**Force Strike.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 40/120 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) force damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.



## Reactions

**Parry (Duelist Only).** The android adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack roll that would hit it. To do so, the android must see the attacker.
