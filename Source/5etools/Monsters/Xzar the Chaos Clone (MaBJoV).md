## Traits

**Chaos Phage.** Xzar's infusion with the Chaos Phage gives him the following benefits:

- Xzar regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point
- Xzar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects
- Xzar has resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, thunder
- Xzar has darkvision and telepathy to 60 feet

**Grim Harvest (1/Turn).** When Xzar kills a creature that is neither a Construct nor Undead with a spell of 1st level or higher, Xzar regains hit points equal to twice the spell's level, or three times if it is a necromancy spell.

**No Soul.** Since Xzar doesn't have a soul, resurrection magic is able to work upon him no matter how much time has passed. For example, the [[revivify]] spell would work on Xzar even a week after he died. However, spells like true resurrection and wish are unable to bring Xzar back to life if no body exists.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Xzar makes two Deprive attacks and uses Spellcasting.

**Deprive.** Attack (ms,rs) +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., or range 120 ft., one target. @h27 (**4d10 + 5**) necrotic damage.

**Death Eruption (1/Day).** Negative energy erupts from Xzar, intensified by the Chaos Phage. Any creature in a 60-foot-radius sphere around Xzar (but not including Xzar) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 36 (**8d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by this ability rises at the start of Xzar's next turn as a zombie under his command.
