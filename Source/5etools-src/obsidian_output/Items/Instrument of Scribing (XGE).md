# Instrument of Scribing

*Wondrous Item, Common* *(requires attunement)*

This musical instrument has 3 charges. While you are playing it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the instrument and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of you. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and choose to make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical darkness. Casting [[dispel magic]] on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.

The instrument regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
