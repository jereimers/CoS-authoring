# Daylight

*3rd-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

---

For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. The sunlight's area is [[Bright Light|XPHB]] and sheds [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 60 feet.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [[Darkness|XPHB]] created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
