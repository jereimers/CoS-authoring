# Potion of Climbing

*Item, Common*

When you drink this potion, you gain a [[Climb Speed|XPHB]] equal to your [[Speed|XPHB]] for 1 hour. During this time, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) checks to climb.

This potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.
