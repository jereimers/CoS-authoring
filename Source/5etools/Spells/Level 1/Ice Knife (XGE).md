# Ice Knife

*1st-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** S, M (a drop of water or piece of ice)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **1d10** piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take **2d6** cold damage.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by `2d6` for each slot level above 1st.
