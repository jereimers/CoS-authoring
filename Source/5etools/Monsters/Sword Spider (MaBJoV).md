## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The sword spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the sword spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The sword spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sword spider makes one Bite attack and two Foreleg attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (**2d8**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and has the [[paralyzed]] condition while [[poisoned]] in this way.

**Foreleg.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage.
