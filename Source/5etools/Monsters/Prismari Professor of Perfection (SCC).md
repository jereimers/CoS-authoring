## Bonus Actions

**Rushing Wave.** The professor is momentarily surrounded by a swirling wave of water and moves up to 30 feet. When the professor moves within 5 feet of any other creature during this bonus action, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw, or the creature is knocked [[prone]] and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. A creature can suffer this effect only once during a turn.
