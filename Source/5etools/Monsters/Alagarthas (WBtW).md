## Traits

**Brave.** Alagarthas has advantage on saving throws against being [[frightened]].

**Fey Ancestry.** Alagarthas has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put him to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Alagarthas makes two melee attacks.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 bludgeoning damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, Alagarthas can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `d4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand him. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if Alagarthas is [[incapacitated]].
