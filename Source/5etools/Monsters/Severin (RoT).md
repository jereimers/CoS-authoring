## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Severin has the [[Mask of the Dragon Queen|rot]].

**Draconic Majesty.** Severin adds his Charisma bonus to his AC (included).

**Ignite Enemy.** If Severin deals fire damage to a creature while wearing the Mask of the Dragon Queen, the target catches fire. At the start of each of its turns, the burning target takes 5 (**1d10**) fire damage. A creature within reach of the fire can use an action to extinguish it.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** While wearing the Mask of the Dragon Queen, if Severin fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Burning Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h18 (**4d8**) fire damage.

**Flaming Orb.** Ranged Spell Attack +9 to hit, range 90 ft., one target. @h40 (**9d8**) fire damage.

**Scorching Burst.** Severin chooses a point he can see within 60 feet of him. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.




## Legendary Actions

If Severin is wearing the Mask of the Dragon Queen, he can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options listed. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Severin regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

**Attack.** Severin makes one attack.

**Fiery Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** Severin, along with any objects he is wearing or carrying, teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Each creature within 5 feet of Severin before he teleports takes 5 (**1d10**) fire damage.

**Hellish Chains (Costs 3 Actions).** Severin targets one creature he can see within 30 feet of him. The target is wrapped in magical chains of fire and [[restrained]]. The [[restrained]] target takes 21 (**6d6**) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of its turns, the target can make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
