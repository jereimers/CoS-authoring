## Traits

**Aura of Doom.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the doom lord must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the doom lord doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition, it can suppress or resume this aura at the start of its turn (no action required).

**Siege Monster.** The doom lord deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Multiattack.** The doom lord makes two Entropic Greatsword or Entropic Javelin attacks.

**Entropic Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage. A creature killed by this attack has its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, reduced to ash.

**Entropic Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage. A creature killed by this attack has its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, reduced to ash.
