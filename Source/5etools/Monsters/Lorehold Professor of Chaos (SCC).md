## Traits

**Voice from the Past (1/Day).** The professor can cast the [[contact other plane]] spell to contact a long-dead spirit, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The professor makes two Spectral Scroll attacks. It can also use Weight of [[History]], if available.

**Spectral Scroll.** Melee Spell Attack +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Weight of History {@recharge 5}.** The professor magically compresses time around up to six creatures of its choice that it can see within 30 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [[restrained]] for 1 minute, but the [[restrained]] target's speed is halved instead of being reduced to 0. At the start of each of its turns, the [[restrained]] target takes 4 (**1d8**) force damage. A [[restrained]] target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
