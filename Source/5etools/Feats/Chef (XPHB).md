# Chef

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Cook's Utensils

You gain proficiency with [[Cook's Utensils|XPHB]] if you don't already have it.

## Replenishing Meal

As part of a [[Short Rest|XPHB]], you can cook special food if you have ingredients and [[Cook's Utensils|XPHB]] on hand. You can prepare enough of this food for a number of creatures equal to 4 plus your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]. At the end of the [[Short Rest|XPHB]], any creature who eats the food and spends one or more Hit Dice to regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]] regains an extra `1d8` [[Hit Points|XPHB]].

## Bolstering Treats

With 1 hour of work or when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you can cook a number of treats equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]] if you have ingredients and [[Cook's Utensils|XPHB]] on hand. These special treats last 8 hours after being made. A creature can use a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to eat one of those treats to gain a number of [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]].
