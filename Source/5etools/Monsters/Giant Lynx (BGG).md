## Traits

**Lynx's Sight (1/Day).** The lynx can cast [[clairvoyance]], requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.

**Woodland Camouflage.** The lynx has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide in undergrowth or snowy terrain.


## Actions

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage. If the lynx moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition. If the target has the [[prone]] condition, the lynx can make another Claws attack against it as a bonus action.
