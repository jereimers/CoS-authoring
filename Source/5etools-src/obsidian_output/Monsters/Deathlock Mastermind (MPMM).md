## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the deathlock's [[darkvision]].

**Turn Resistance.** The deathlock has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns Undead.

**Unusual Nature.** The deathlock doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The deathlock makes two Deathly Claw or Grave Bolt attacks.

**Deathly Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d6 + 3** necrotic damage).

**Grave Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d8**) necrotic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become [[restrained]] as shadowy tendrils wrap around it for 1 minute. A [[restrained]] target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
