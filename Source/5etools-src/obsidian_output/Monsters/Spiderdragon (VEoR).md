## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The spiderdragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The spiderdragon can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Walker.** The spiderdragon ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spiderdragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) piercing damage plus 13 (**2d12**) poison damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Spiderling Breath {@recharge 5}.** The spiderdragon exhales venomous spiderlings in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (**6d10**) piercing damage and 33 (**6d10**) poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Bonus Actions

**Stifling Webs {@recharge 5}.** The spiderdragon spins a 30-foot cube of strong, sticky webbing in an area adjacent to itself. The webbing lasts for 1 minute, is difficult terrain, and lightly obscures its area. A creature that starts its turn in the webbing or enters the webbing for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[restrained]] condition while in the web. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from the web by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check.

A 5-foot cube of the web is destroyed if it takes at least 10 acid, fire, or slashing damage on a single turn.
