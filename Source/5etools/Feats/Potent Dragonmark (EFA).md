# Potent Dragonmark

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Dragonmark Preparation

You always have the spells on your Spells of the Mark list (if any) prepared.

## Dragonmark Spellcasting

You have one extra spell slot to cast the spells granted by your Dragonmark feat. The spell slot's level is half your level (round up), to a maximum of level 5. You regain the expended slot when you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can use this spell slot to cast only a spell you have prepared because of your Dragonmark feat or the Dragonmark Preparation benefit of this feat.
