# Wings of Flying

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to turn the cloak into a pair of wings on your back. The wings lasts for 1 hour or until you end the effect early as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action. The wings give you a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] of 60 feet. If you are aloft when the wings disappear, you fall. When the wings disappear, you can't use them again for `1d12` hours.
