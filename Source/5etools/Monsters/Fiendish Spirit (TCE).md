## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The fiend has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Death Throes (Demon Only).** When the fiend drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the fiend explodes, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes **2d10 + summonSpellLevel** fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Devil's Sight (Devil Only).** Magical darkness doesn't impede the fiend's darkvision.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The fiend makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

**Bite (Demon Only).** Melee Weapon Attack @hitYourSpellAttack to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h**1d12 + 3 + summonSpellLevel** necrotic damage.

**Claws (Yugoloth Only).** Melee Weapon Attack @hitYourSpellAttack to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h**1d8 + 3 + summonSpellLevel** slashing damage. Immediately after the attack hits or misses, the fiend can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Hurl Flame (Devil Only).** Ranged Spell Attack @hitYourSpellAttack to hit, range 150 ft., one target. @h**2d6 + 3 + summonSpellLevel** fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
