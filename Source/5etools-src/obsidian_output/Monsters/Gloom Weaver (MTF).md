## Traits

**Burden of Time.** Beasts and humanoids, other than shadar-kai, have disadvantage on saving throws while within 10 feet of the gloom weaver.

**Fey Ancestry.** The gloom weaver has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put it to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The gloom weaver makes two spear attacks and casts one spell that takes 1 action to cast.

**Shadow Spear.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 26 (**4d12**) necrotic damage, or 8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage plus 26 (**4d12**) necrotic damage if used with two hands.



## Reactions

**Misty Escape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** When the gloom weaver takes damage, it turns [[invisible]] and teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It remains [[invisible]] until the start of its next turn or until it attacks or casts a spell.
