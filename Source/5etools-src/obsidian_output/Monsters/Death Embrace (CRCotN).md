## Traits

**Petrifying Tendrils.** Any creature that starts its turn in the death embrace's space must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is [[restrained]]. A creature [[restrained]] in this way must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [[petrified]] on a failed saving throw or ending the effect on a successful one. The [[petrified]] condition lasts until the effect is ended by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.

**Reel.** At the start of each of its turns, the death embrace can pull each creature it is grappling up to 20 feet toward it (no action required).

**Water Breathing.** The death embrace can breathe only underwater.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The death embrace makes two Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) psychic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is also [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). The death embrace has six tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.



## Reactions

**Body Shield.** When the death embrace is hit by an attack, one creature the death embrace is grappling (chosen by the death embrace) takes the damage instead.
