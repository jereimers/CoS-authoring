# Who they are

The Darklord. The Devil. The master of [[Castle Ravenloft]]. He is the ancient. He is the land. He is Count Strahd von Zarovich.

# What the party knows

- He's the big bad end guy. There's so much (***so. much.***) you don't know about him.
- Has his sights (and his fangs) set on [[Ireena Kolyana]]
- When he was a mortal, he was wounded in battle and nursed back to health by a travelling group of [[Vistani]]. For this reason, he grants free passage in and out of his realm to all descendants of this noble, nomadic people (see [[Stanimir's Tale]]).
- He lives in a big old spooky castle overlooking the [[Village of Barovia]]

# Personality

- Smug, confident, commanding. Knows he could kill you with a thought.

# Where we've seen them

- [[Session 05 - Out of Barovia#An Encounter with Strahd|Session 5]] — you met him while traveling along the [[Old Svalich Road]], and [[Choppy Gibbles|Choppy]] *almost* got you killed!
