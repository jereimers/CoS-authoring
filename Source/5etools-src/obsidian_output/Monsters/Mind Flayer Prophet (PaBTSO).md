## Traits

**Awareness.** The mind flayer has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised as long as it doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition.

**Magic Resistance.** The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16) and must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the grapple ends.

**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Humanoid [[grappled]] by the mind flayer. @h55 (**10d10**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills it by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Whip {@recharge 5}.** The mind flayer lashes out with psychic energy, targeting up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 23 (**4d8 + 5**) psychic damage and have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
