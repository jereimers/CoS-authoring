# Berserker

*Primal Path for [[Barbarian]]*

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end--that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.
