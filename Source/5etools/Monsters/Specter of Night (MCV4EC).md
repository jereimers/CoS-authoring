## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the specter fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The specter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The specter uses Mournful Keening if available, then makes one Hooves attack and one Reaping Scythe attack.

**Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 28 (**8d6**) necrotic damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Mournful Keening {@recharge}.** The specter utters a keening wail, calling to those close to death. Each non-Undead creature within 120 feet of the specter must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature hears the wail and is marked for death.

A creature marked for death can't regain hit points, has disadvantage on death saving throws, and all attack rolls against it are made with advantage. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until the creature is targeted by a [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.

**Reaping Scythe.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**1d12 + 6**) slashing damage plus 28 (**8d6**) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain a level of [[exhaustion]].
