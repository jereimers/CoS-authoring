## Actions

**Multiattack.** The muse makes two Beguiling Resonance attacks.

**Beguiling Resonance.** Attack (ms,rs) +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 90 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d8**) psychic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes until the end of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Enchanting Presence.** Each creature within 30 feet of the muse must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[charmed]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any muse's Enchanting Presence for 24 hours.

Whenever the muse deals damage to the [[charmed]] creature, the [[charmed]] creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
