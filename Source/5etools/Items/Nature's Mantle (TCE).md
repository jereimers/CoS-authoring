# Nature's Mantle

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is lightly obscured, you can [[Hide]] as a bonus action even if you are being directly observed.
