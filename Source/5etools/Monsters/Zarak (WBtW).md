## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Zarak carries a [[potion of invisibility]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Zarak makes two Dagger attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage, plus an extra 5 (**2d4**) piercing damage if the target is a creature and Zarak has at least 18 hit points.

**Garrote.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Humanoid. @h8 (**2d4 + 3**) slashing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target takes 8 (**2d4 + 3**) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and Zarak can't grapple another creature or use Assassin's Whim.


## Bonus Actions

**Assassin's Whim.** Zarak takes the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.


## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** Zarak halves the damage he takes from an attack made against him, provided he can see the attacker.
