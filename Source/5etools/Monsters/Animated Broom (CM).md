## Traits

**False Object.** If the broom is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the broom move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check to discern that the broom is animate.

**Flyby.** The broom doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The broom makes two melee attacks.

**Broomstick.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) bludgeoning damage.
