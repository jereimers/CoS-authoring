## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The slaad has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** The slaad regains 10 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The slaad makes three Mutating Claw attacks.

**Mutating Claw.** m +8, reach 10 ft. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) Slashing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) Poison damage. If the target is a Humanoid not cursed by a slaad, it is subjected to the following effect. con DC 15. @actSaveFail The target is cursed. The cursed target can't regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]], and its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] maximum decreases by 10 (`3d6`) after every 24 hours and doesn't return to normal after finishing a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. If the curse reduces the target's [[Hit Points|XPHB]] maximum to 0, the curse ends, and instead of dying, the target instantly transforms into a [[Red Slaad|XMM]] or, if it can cast spells of level 3 or higher, a [[Green Slaad|XMM]]. Only a [[Wish|XPHB]] spell can reverse this transformation.
