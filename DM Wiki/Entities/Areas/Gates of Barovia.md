%% an area is a location, place, region, etc. It can be as large as the Planes of Existence and as small as a room inside a building inside a town inside a region inside a domain inside a continent/plane. Areas have types, are encountered by the party at a particular time/place, and can be home to multiple NPCs, items, etc. %%
# Overview

The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.
