# Banishment

*4th-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pentacle)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice) associated with its creature type.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
