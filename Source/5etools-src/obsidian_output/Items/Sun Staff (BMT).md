# Sun Staff

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or wizard)*

Veins of sunstone run through this wooden staff. This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack roll using this staff, the target takes an extra **1d8** fire damage.

## Solar Focus

You can use the staff as a spellcasting focus. While holding the staff, you can reroll a number of damage dice up to your proficiency bonus when you use a spell slot to cast a spell that deals fire or radiant damage. You must use the new rolls. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Sunny Glow

As a bonus action, you can cause the staff to glow with sunlight. While glowing, the staff sheds Vision and Light in a 15-foot radius and Vision and Light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you use another bonus action to extinguish it.
