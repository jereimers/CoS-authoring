## Traits

**Evasion.** When subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Molliver takes no damage on a successful save or half damage on a failed one, provided Molliver is not [[incapacitated]].

**Special Equipment.** Molliver wears [[+1 leather armor]] and [[boots of levitation]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Molliver makes two Dagger or Shortsword attacks, or one of each.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage. The attack deals an extra 7 (**2d6**) piercing damage if Molliver has advantage on the attack roll or if the target is within 5 feet of one of Molliver's allies.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage. The attack deals an extra 7 (**2d6**) piercing damage if Molliver has advantage on the attack roll or if the target is within 5 feet of one of Molliver's allies.

**Levitate.** While wearing boots of levitation, Molliver casts [[levitate]] (self only).



## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** Molliver halves the damage they take from an attack made against them, provided they can see the attacker.
