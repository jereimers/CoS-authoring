**Magic Resistance.** The erinyes has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The erinyes makes three attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 13 (**3d8**) poison damage.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]].
