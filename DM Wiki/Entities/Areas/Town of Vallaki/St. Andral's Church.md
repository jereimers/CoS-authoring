# Overview
This slouching, centuries-old stone church has a bulging steeple in the back and walls lined with cracked, stained glass windows depicting pious saints. A fence of wrought iron encloses a garden of gravestones next to the church. A thin mist creeps among the graves.

# What the party knows
- This church is dedicated to the Morninglord and named after St. Andral.
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] oversees the church and does his best to raise spirits. Assisting him is an altar boy, also a recent orphan, named [[Yeska]].
- The church is somehow sanctified as hallowed ground, providing respite and protection from the forces of darkness — including [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and his minions
