## Traits

**Amphibious.** The kuo-toa can breathe air and water.

**Otherworldly Perception.** The kuo-toa can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is [[invisible]] or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.

**Slippery.** The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) piercing damage.

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage, or 5 (**1d8 + 1**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Net.** Ranged Weapon Attack +3 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one Large or smaller creature. @hThe target is [[restrained]]. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to free itself or another creature in a net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) frees the target without harming it and destroys the net.



## Reactions

**Sticky Shield.** When a creature misses the kuo-toa with a melee weapon attack, the kuo-toa uses its sticky shield to catch the weapon. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw, or the weapon becomes stuck to the kuo-toa's shield. If the weapon's wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is [[grappled]] while the weapon is stuck. While stuck, the weapon can't be used. A creature can pull the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 11 Strength check and succeeding.
