# Freedom of Movement

*4th-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

---

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]], and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's [[Speed|XPHB]] nor cause the target to have the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] or [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions. The target also has a [[Swim Speed|XPHB]] equal to its [[Speed|XPHB]].

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition on it.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
