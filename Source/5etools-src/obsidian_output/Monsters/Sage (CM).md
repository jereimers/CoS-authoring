## Actions

**Shocking Grasp (Cantrip).** Melee Spell Attack +6 to hit (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal), reach 5 ft., one creature. @h9 (**2d8**) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.



## Reactions

**Shield (1st-Level Spell; 3/Day).** When the sage is hit by an attack or targeted by a [[magic missile]] spell, it calls forth an [[invisible]] barrier of magical force that protects it. Until the start of its next turn, the sage has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and it takes no damage from magic missile.
