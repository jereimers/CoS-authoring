You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **5d8** Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals **5d8** Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `5d8` for each spell slot level above 4.
