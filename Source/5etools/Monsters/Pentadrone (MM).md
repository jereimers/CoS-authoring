## Traits

**Axiomatic Mind.** The pentadrone can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Disintegration.** If the pentadrone dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The pentadrone makes five arm attacks.

**Arm.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Paralysis Gas {@recharge 5}.** The pentadrone exhales a 30-foot cone of gas. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
