# Final Breath

*Curse*

A deity's favored servant lies dying and calls down divine wrath.

### Pronouncement

The dying creature declares to the killer, "May your mind grow dim in battle until the sun sets forever."

### Burden

The character has disadvantage on attack rolls brought on by brief, sporadic bouts of confusion.

### Resolution

To lift the curse, the character must cause a symbolic setting of the sun or an empowering of the night to appease the slain creature's deity. The character might prevent a festival dedicated to a sun god or perform a ritual that shrouds an entire settlement in magical night for 24 hours, thus ending the curse.
