# Quiver of Ehlonna

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 [[Arrow|XPHB]], [[Bolt|XPHB]], or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 [[Javelin|XPHB]] or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, [[Quarterstaff|XPHB]], or [[Spear|XPHB]].

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
