[[Non-Player Characters#Claudiu Martikov]]
* **Claudiu** doesn’t care about Davian’s feud with Urwin, and believes that Elric’s death was a clear signal that resisting Strahd is hopeless and anyone who does so is doomed to failure. He most often feels grim, bored, annoyed, frustrated, or melancholy, and should make the players feel irritated, insulted, and sympathetic to him.
