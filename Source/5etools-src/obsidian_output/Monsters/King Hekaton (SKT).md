## Traits

**Amphibious.** Hekaton can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Hekaton makes two broken chain attacks.

**Broken Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d6 + 9**) bludgeoning damage.

**Ballista.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d10 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Lightning Strike {@recharge 5}.** Hekaton hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point he can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (**12d8**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Thunderous Stomp {@recharge}.** Hekaton stomps the ground, triggering a thunderclap. All other creatures within 15 feet of him must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 33 (**6d10**) thunder damage and be [[deafened]] until the start of Hekaton's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[deafened]]. The thunderclap can be heard out to a range of 1,200 feet.
