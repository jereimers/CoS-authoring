## Traits

**Aura of Murder.** As long as the reaper is not [[incapacitated]], hostile creatures within 5 feet of it gain vulnerability to piercing damage unless they have resistance or immunity to such damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The reaper makes two dagger attacks and uses Shroud Self.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d4 + 5**) piercing damage.

**Shroud Self.** The reaper magically turns [[invisible]] until the start of its next turn. This invisibility ends if the reaper makes an attack roll, makes a damage roll, or casts a spell.
