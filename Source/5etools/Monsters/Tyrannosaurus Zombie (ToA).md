## Traits

**Disgorge Zombie.** As a bonus action, the tyrannosaurus zombie can disgorge a normal [[zombie]], which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. The disgorged [[zombie]] acts on its own initiative count. After a zombie is disgorged, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1, the tyrannosaurus zombie runs out of zombies to disgorge and loses this trait. If the tyrannosaurus zombie still has this trait when it dies, `1d4` normal zombies erupt from its corpse at the start of its next turn. These zombies act on their own initiative count.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the tyrannosaurus zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The tyrannosaurus zombie makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h33 (**4d12 + 7**) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]] and the tyrannosaurus zombie can't bite another target or disgorge zombies.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.
