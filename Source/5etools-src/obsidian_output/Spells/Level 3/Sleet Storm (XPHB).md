Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point you choose within range. The area is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]], and exposed flames in the area are doused.

Ground in the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]]. When a creature enters the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition and lose [[Concentration]].
