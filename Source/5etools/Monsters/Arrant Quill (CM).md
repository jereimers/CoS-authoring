## Actions

**Multiattack.** Quill makes two attacks with his dagger and uses Supreme Mockery.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Quill's Fable {@recharge}.** Quill utters a short fable while targeting up to five creatures within 30 feet of him that he can see. Each target that can hear Quill's magical fable must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, taking 36 (**8d8**) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Supreme Mockery.** Quill hurls a string of insults laced with enchantments at a creature he can see within 60 feet of him. If the creature can hear Quill (though it need not understand him), it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 66 (**12d10**) psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
