# Boon of Fluid Forms

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Shapechanger

You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to shape-shift into a Beast, Humanoid, or Monstrosity with a [[Challenge Rating|XPHB]] no higher than 10. When you shape-shift, you gain a number of [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the [[Hit Points|XPHB]] of the form. The shape-shifting effect lasts for 1 hour, and it ends early if you have no [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] left or if you take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to return to your true form.

Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; [[Hit Points|XPHB]]; [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]]; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, you retain it too. Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.

Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Hardy Transformation

When you gain [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] when you shape-shift, increase that number of [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] by 20.
