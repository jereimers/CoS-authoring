# Rime's Binding Ice

*2nd-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (30-feet cone)  
**Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **3d8** cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't hindered by ice.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold damage by `3d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
