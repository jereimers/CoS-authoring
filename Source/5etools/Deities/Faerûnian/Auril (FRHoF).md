# Auril

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Auril, the merciless god of cold indifference, embodies winter's cruelty. Auril's beloved ice grips all things in her clutches, preserving them against the ravages of time. She hoards beauty in all forms, from art objects and flowers to skilled artisans and their wondrous works, freezing them in magical ice for her pleasure alone. If she deigns to speak to a mortal, her voice whispers like icy needles on the cold wind, or she sends a [[Yeti|XMM]] or an [[Air Elemental|XMM]] to speak on her behalf.

Auril is worshiped in regions affected by deep winters, notably [[Icewind Dale|FRHoF]] during the supernaturally long night known as the Everlasting Rime. Individuals propitiate Auril with offerings and prayers for mercy. Few favor Auril, except those who make their livelihood from winter or those who truly love the season. Worshipers stock food, fuel, and other sources of comfort and warmth, which they sacrifice to Auril for deliverance from harsh winters. In times of deep desperation, however, sapient beings might be left in the deadly cold as a sacrifice to the Frostmaiden.

Auril's priests tend to be people who would, but for their status, be outcasts from their communities. They avoid personal relationships, remaining aloof when not serving in their official capacity. Her priests warn local residents to prepare for winter and stock extra provisions so they have offerings for Auril.

The rituals of Auril's worship seem cruel to outsiders. In [[Luskan|FRHoF]], Auril's temple is the Winter Palace, a roofless array of pillars and arches carved of white stone. Visitors gather here to watch a ritual in which supplicants don garments packed with ice. These supplicants then journey between six white pillars known as the Kisses of Auril, dispersed throughout the city. The worshipers move from pillar to pillar, chanting prayers to the god. On reaching a pillar, a supplicant must climb it and touch the rusty iron plate at the top. In winter, these events resemble frantic footraces, with the added risk of frostbite and injuries caused by falling from the slippery pillars.

Auril's Chosen are spies or assassins who root out the agents of her enemies. She has invested few known Chosen, the most prominent being the Harper agent Artus Cimber.
