# Purphoros's Devotee

*Piety Trait*

*Piety 3+ Purphoros trait*

As a devotee of Purphoros, you have drawn the notice of the forge god with your skill. You can cast [[shield of faith]] with this trait, requiring no material components, a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, you know the [[mending]] cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
