## Traits

**Amphibious.** The giant can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two Battleaxe attacks and one Harpoon attack.

**Battleaxe.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) slashing damage, or 22 (**3d10 + 6**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 7 (**2d6**) cold damage.

**Harpoon.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one creature. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16). While the target is [[grappled]] this way, its speed isn't reduced, but it can't move farther from the giant. The target takes 5 (**1d10**) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. The giant can grapple only one target at a time with its harpoon.


## Bonus Actions

**Reel In.** The giant pulls the target [[grappled]] by its Harpoon up to 20 feet toward itself.
