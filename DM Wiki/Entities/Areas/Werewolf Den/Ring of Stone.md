# Z8. Ring of Stone

%% --- Page 284 --- %%
A twenty-foot-diameter ring of stones dominates a rocky ledge on the mountainside. Within the ring, you see spattered blood and small, gnawed bones. Lying on the ground outside the circle are several spears stained with dry blood.

The werewolf pack convenes here to watch their young prisoners fight with spears in the stone ring. The last child standing is bitten and turned into a werewolf; then the bodies of the dead are devoured, their bones picked clean.

Set into the mountainside is a secret door that can be pushed open to reveal a tunnel with rough-hewn stairs leading down to area Z6.
