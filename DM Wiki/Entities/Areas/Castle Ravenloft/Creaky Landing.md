# K29. Creaky Landing 

<div class="description"><p>This staircase is made of old wood that strains underfoot, creaking and groaning.</p></div>

The staircase climbs from area K16 to area K28. It seems unstable but is sturdy. The creatures in area K28 can't be surprised by anyone climbing the creaky steps.
