## Traits

**Stench.** Any creature other than a catoblepas that starts its turn within 10 feet of the catoblepas must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Stench of any catoblepas for 1 hour.


## Actions

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h21 (**5d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the start of the catoblepas's next turn.

**Death Ray {@recharge 5}.** The catoblepas targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (**8d8**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target instead takes 64 necrotic damage. The target dies if reduced to 0 hit points by this ray.
