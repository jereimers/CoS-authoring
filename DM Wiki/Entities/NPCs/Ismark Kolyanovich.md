## Portrait
![[03-002.ismark-kolyanovich.png]]
## **Roleplaying Information**
***Resonance.*** Ismark should inspire flattery with his genuine interest and empathy for the players, sympathy for his guilt and desperation, endearment for his anxiety to step beyond his ancestor's shadow, and gratitude for his friendliness and aid.

***Emotions.*** Ismark most often feels concerned, guilty, friendly, melancholy, defiant, hopeful, desperate, and grateful.

***Motivations.*** Ismark wants to keep his village and Ireena safe, keep his father's memory alive, and one day match his ancestor's legacy.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Ismark, channel Jon Snow (*Game of Thrones*), Faramir (*Lord of the Rings*), and Trevor Belmont (*Castlevania*).

## **Character Information**
***Persona.*** To the world, Ismark is a courageous, reliable, and compassionate leader. To those he trusts, Ismark is a self-doubting, struggling warrior desperate to keep his loved ones safe. Deep down, Ismark worries that he will never live up to his ancestor's deeds—and fears that he has already irreparably failed.

***Morale.*** In a fight, Ismark would first seek to mediate the parties' conflict, but would gladly draw his sword—and even fight to the death—if he believed that he was fighting for something or someone worth protecting.

***Relationships.*** Ismark is the adoptive brother of [[Ireena Kolyana]], and the great-grandson of Ismark the Great.
