# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While this bowl is filled with water and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to summon a [[Water Elemental|XMM]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the bowl as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]]. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It holds about 3 gallons.
