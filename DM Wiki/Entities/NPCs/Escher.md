# Who They Are

One of [[Source/CoS-Reloaded/Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd's]] many "associates". A former bard from [[Village of Barovia|Barovia]] who was friend to [[Doru]] and involved in his doomed rebellion, Escher was made a vampire spawn by Strahd and now lives in [[Castle Ravenloft]] as one of his consorts.

# What the Party Knows

## First Encounter at River Ivlis Crossroads

From [[Session 05 - Out of Barovia|Session 05]] at the River Ivlis Crossroads, the party learned:

### Initial Meeting

- The party first encountered Escher on Neyavr 1, 735, when he arrived driving [[Source/CoS-Reloaded/Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd's]] black carriage
- Escher stepped down from the coach box and opened the carriage door for Strahd, bowing deeply
- [[Source/CoS-Reloaded/Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] introduced him as "Escher, my coachman and cupbearer"

### What They Observed

- Escher is one of Strahd's vampiric consorts—a vampire spawn serving the lord of Barovia
- He appeared as a handsome, youthful man in elegant but somewhat worn attire befitting a member of Strahd's court
- Throughout the entire encounter, Escher remained completely silent and submissive to Strahd's authority
- He stood demurely at Strahd's side, never responding to any questions or statements from the party
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] gasped at the sight of him, whispering that she thought he was dead—suggesting she had known him before his transformation

### His Role

- Serves as Strahd's coachman and cupbearer
- A vampire spawn and favored associate of the vampire lord
- Lives in [[Castle Ravenloft]] as one of Strahd's consorts

## Connection to Arabelle's Abduction

- The party suspects Escher may be connected to [[Arabelle]]'s disappearance based on the evidence at the crime scene
- The exact nature of his involvement remains unclear, but the fragment of his silk shirt found in the tree puts him undeniably at the scene.
- [[Victor Vallakovich]] believes investigating [[Khazan]]'s tower on [[Lake Baratok]] might reveal more about the ring and its connection to the abduction

# Personality

- Simp for Strahd

# Where We've Seen Them

- [[Session 05 - Out of Barovia|Session 05]] — First encountered at River Ivlis Crossroads as Strahd's coachman
- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#CSI Luna River|Session 13]] — Evidence at [[Luna River]] crime scene suggests his involvement in Arabelle's abduction

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Escher should make the players feel amused and flattered with his flamboyantly flirtatious behavior, irritated with his snide or condescending commentary, and, eventually, sympathetic to his unspoken guilt for his role in bringing harm to his friends and neighbors by awakening Strahd.

### Emotions
Escher most often feels annoyed, curious, angry, smug, anxious, fearful, playful, mischievous, amused, guilty, bitter, regretful, or ashamed.

### Motivations
Escher wants to please Strahd and avoid falling from his favor.

### Inspirations
When roleplaying Escher, channel Astarion (*Baldur's Gate 3*), Crowley (*Good Omens*), and Renly Baratheon (*Game of Thrones*).

### Vocal Notes


### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Escher is a flamboyant and self-assured member of Strahd's court, with a love for preening, luxuries, and attention. Only Escher knows that he is a guilt-ridden, self-loathing, broken man who longs desperately for Strahd's approval and has long since resigned himself to the cage his choices have trapped him in.

### Morale
In a fight, Escher would seek to entreat or flee his adversary, fighting only if cornered or if grievously offended.

### Relationships
Before becoming one of Strahd's consorts, Escher had a crush on Doru, his former best friend. He is now one of Strahd's consorts—though not formally wed to him—and an inferior member of Strahd's court.
