# Cyrus Belview Profile

## Portrait
![[04-010.cyrus-belview.png]]

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Cyrus should inspire endearment for his sincere efforts to make himself useful despite his physical handicaps and poor memory, amusement for his grumpiness and bizarrely opinionated (and occasionally conspiratorial) rants, and discomfort with his inability to appreciate the boundaries of personal space.

### Emotions
Cyrus most often feels curious, intrigued, determined, agitated, impatient, or skeptical.

### Motivations
Cyrus wants to help Strahd restore Castle Ravenloft, believing that Strahd will furnish him with the knowledge required to restore his family to their original forms.

### Inspirations
When playing Cyrus, channel Ebenezar Scrooge (*A Christmas Carol*), Grandpa Simpson (*The Simpsons*), and Grand Maester Pycelle (*Game of Thrones*).

## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Cyrus is a doddering old butler with an affinity for conspiratorial rants. To those he trusts—and in his moments of lucidity—Cyrus is a sad old man who has long since resigned himself to the belief that his family is forever damned for their ancestors’ sins.

### Morale
In a fight, Cyrus would cower in a corner, brandishing any nearby object as an impromptu weapon but immediately surrendering if actually wounded.

### Relationships
Cyrus is the former patriarch of the Belview family and the butler of Castle Ravenloft.
