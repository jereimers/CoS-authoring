## Actions

**Multiattack.** The diviner makes three Arcane Burst attacks.

**Arcane Burst.** Attack (ms,rs) +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d10 + 4**) radiant damage.

**Overwhelming Revelation {@recharge 5}.** The diviner magically creates a burst of illumination in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (**10d8**) psychic damage and is [[stunned]] until the end of the diviner's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[stunned]].



## Reactions

**Portent (3/Day).** When the diviner or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the diviner rolls a `d20` and chooses whether to use that roll in place of the `d20` rolled for the attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.
