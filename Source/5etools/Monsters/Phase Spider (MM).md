## Traits

**Ethereal Jaunt.** As a bonus action, the spider can magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.

**Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.
