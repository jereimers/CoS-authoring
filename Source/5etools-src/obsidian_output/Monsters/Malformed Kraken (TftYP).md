## Traits

**Amphibious.** The kraken can breathe air and water.

**Siege Monster.** The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks. One of them can be replaced with a bite attack, and any of them can be replaced with Fling.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) piercing damage.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d6 + 7**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]]. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling.** One Medium or smaller object held or creature [[grappled]] by the kraken's tentacles is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked [[prone]]. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [[prone]].

**Lightning Storm.** The kraken creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 150 feet of it. A target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (**3d10**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
