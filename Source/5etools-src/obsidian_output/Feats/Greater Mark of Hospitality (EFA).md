# Greater Mark of Hospitality

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Improved Intuition

When you use the Ever Hospitable benefit of your [[Mark of Hospitality|EFA]] feat, you can roll `1d6` instead of `1d4`.

## Improved Hospitality

When you cast [[Purify Food and Drink|XPHB]], you can modify the spell so that instead of its normal effect, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you is refreshed. Each affected creature's [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level is reduced by 1, and the creature gains [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]] plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this feat). Once you modify the spell with this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
