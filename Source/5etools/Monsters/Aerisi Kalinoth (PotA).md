## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Aerisi has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put her to sleep.

**Howling Defeat.** When Aerisi drops to 0 hit points, her body disappears in a howling whirlwind that disperses quickly and harmlessly. Anything she is wearing or carrying is left behind.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Aerisi fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Windvane.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d6 + 6**) piercing damage, or 10 (**1d8 + 6**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (**1d6**) lightning damage.
