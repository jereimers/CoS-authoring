## Actions

**Multiattack.** The behir makes one Bite attack and uses Constrict.

**Bite.** m +10, reach 10 ft. @h19 (**2d12 + 6**) Piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) Lightning damage.

**Constrict.** str DC 18, one Large or smaller creature the behir can see within 5 feet. @actSaveFail 28 (**5d8 + 6**) Bludgeoning damage. The target has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 16), and it has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the grapple ends.

**Lightning Breath {@recharge 5}.** dex DC 16, each creature in a 90-foot-long, 5-foot-wide [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. @actSaveFail 66 (**12d10**) Lightning damage. @actSaveSuccess Half damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Swallow.** dex DC 18, one Large or smaller creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by the behir (the behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time). @actSaveFail The behir swallows the target, which is no longer [[Grappled|XPHB]]. While swallowed, a creature has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions, has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and takes 21 (**6d6**) Acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns.

If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls in a space within 10 feet of the behir and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[Restrained|XPHB]] and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [[Prone|XPHB]].
