# Earth Tremor

*1st-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **1d6** bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[prone]]. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 1st.
