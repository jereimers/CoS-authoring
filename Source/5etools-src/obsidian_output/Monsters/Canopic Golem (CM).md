## Traits

**Limited Spell Immunity.** The golem automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells of 7th level or lower, and the attack rolls of such spells always miss it.

**Unusual Nature.** The golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The golem makes two attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h27 (**4d10 + 5**) force damage.

**Crystal Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) force damage.



## Reactions

**Spell Deflection.** In response to a spell attack missing the golem, it causes that spell to hit another creature within 120 feet of it that it can see.
