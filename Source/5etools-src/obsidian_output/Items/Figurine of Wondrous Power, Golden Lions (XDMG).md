# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Golden Lions

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

A [[Figurine of Wondrous Power|XDMG]] is a statuette small enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a living creature specified in the figurine's description below. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a creature.

The creature is [[Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB]] to you and your allies. It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if its creature form drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] or if you take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action while touching the creature to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified below.

## Golden Lions (Rare)

These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a [[Lion|XMM]] for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.
