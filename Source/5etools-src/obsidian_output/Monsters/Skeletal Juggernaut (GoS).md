## Traits

**Disassemble.** If the juggernaut is reduced to 0 hit points, twelve skeletons rise from its remains.

**Falling Apart.** If the juggernaut does not have all of its hit points at the start of its turn, it loses 10 hit points.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The juggernaut makes two claws attacks.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Avalanche of Bones {@recharge 5}.** The juggernaut collapses into a large heap before quickly reforming. Each creature within 10 feet of the juggernaut must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw is also knocked [[prone]].
