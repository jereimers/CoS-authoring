# Lightning Arrow

*3rd-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target takes **4d8** lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage.

Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes **2d8** lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by `4d8;2d8` for each slot level above 3rd.
