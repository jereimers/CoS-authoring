## Traits

**Fear Aura.** Each creature of the golem's choice that starts its turn within 20 feet of the golem must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw unless the golem is [[incapacitated]]. On a failed save, the creature is [[frightened]] until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this golem's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

**Magic Resistance.** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unusual Nature.** The golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The golem makes one Pinion attack and two Rend attacks.

**Pinion.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is pinned beneath the bony pinion and [[restrained]]. The golem has two pinions, each of which can restrain one target. If a creature is [[restrained]] by one of the pinions, the golem can't attack with it. Any creature [[restrained]] by a pinion can free itself at the start of its turn with a successful DC 17 Strength ([[Athletics]]) check.

**Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) necrotic damage.

**Petrifying Breath {@recharge 5}.** The golem emits a 60-foot cone of petrifying gas from its mouth. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 35 (**10d6**) poison damage and be [[restrained]] as it begins to turn to stone. The [[restrained]] target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target is [[petrified]].
