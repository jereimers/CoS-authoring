## Traits

**Divine Strike.** Once on each of his turns when he hits a creature with a weapon attack, Omin can cause the attack to deal an extra 4 (**1d8**) damage of the same type dealt by the weapon.

**Fey Ancestry.** Omin has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put him to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Omin makes two attacks with his maul.

**Maul.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage.



## Reactions

**War God's Blessing (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** When a creature within 30 feet of Omin makes an attack roll, but before learning whether it hits or misses, Omin can grant the creature a +10 bonus to that roll.
