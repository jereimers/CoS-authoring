# Ring of Spell Turning

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells. If you succeed on the save for a spell of level 7 or lower, the spell has no effect on you. If that spell targeted only you and didn't create an area of effect, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to deflect the spell back at the spell's caster; the caster must make a saving throw against the spell using their own spell save DC.
