## Traits

**Brain Dump.** Whenever the neh-thalggu consumes a brain, it gains the magical ability to speak and understand languages known by the brain's previous owner.

**Unusual Nature.** The neh-thalggu doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The neh-thalggu makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d8 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [[incapacitated]] Humanoid. @h35 (**10d6**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the neh-thalggu kills the target by extracting and consuming its brain.

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** The neh-thalggu magically emits psychic energy at one Humanoid it can see within 10 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 9 (**2d8**) psychic damage and is [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't [[incapacitated]].
