# Objective
Escort [[Ireena Kolyana]] safely from the [[Village of Barovia]] to [[St. Andral's Church]] in [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], where she can find sanctuary from [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].

# What the Party knows
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] asked the party to escort his sister [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to the fortified town of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], where she might find safety from [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]].
- Strahd has "claimed" Ireena and marked her as his own. She bears two bite marks on her neck from previous encounters with the vampire lord.
- Ireena is a capable fighter and refuses to be seen as merely a victim. She insists that her journey is "diplomatic and humanitarian" and that the party serves as her escorts and bodyguards.
- Ismark believes [[St. Andral's Church]] in Vallaki may offer Ireena hallowed protection from Strahd's reach.
- The party encountered Strahd himself at the River Ivlis Crossroads, where he acknowledged his interest in Ireena but agreed to let her depart—for the moment.

# Leads
- [[St. Andral's Church]] is located in [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and is said to offer protection from the undead.
- The [[Blue Water Inn]] can provide lodging while the party arranges Ireena's sanctuary.
- The roads between Barovia and Vallaki are dangerous, with wolves, werewolves, and other threats stalking travelers.

# Appearance in Sessions
- [[Session 02 - Arrival at Barovia]]
- [[Session 07 - The Tarokka Reading]]

# Secrets
- Ireena is one of Strahd's obsessions—a reincarnation of Tatyana, the woman he loved in life and whose soul he has pursued across centuries.
- St. Andral's Church is only protected so long as the bones of St. Andral remain beneath the altar. The bones have recently been stolen (see [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast]]).
- Ireena was not born in the village of Barovia. She was found wandering the Svalich Woods as a young child and adopted by Kolyan Indirovich. Her true origins lie in Vallaki—and she is the sister of [[Izek Strazni]].
