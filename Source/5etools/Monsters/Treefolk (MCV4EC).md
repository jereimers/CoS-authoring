## Traits

**Plant Camouflage.** The treefolk has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks it makes in forest terrain.

**Tree Stride.** Once on each of its turns, the treefolk can use 10 feet of its movement to step magically into one living tree within 5 feet of itself and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of itself that it can see, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be at least as large as the treefolk.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The treefolk makes two Crushing Vine attacks, two Nightshade Bolt attacks, or one of each.

**Crushing Vine.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h25 (**3d12 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 18). While [[grappled]], the creature also has the [[restrained]] condition. The treefolk can grapple up to six creatures this way.

**Nightshade Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +9 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h33 (**6d10**) poison damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Oaken Boon.** The treefolk blesses one creature other than itself that it can see within 60 feet of itself with the might and wisdom of the forest. While blessed in this way, a creature can use the treefolk's Tree Stride trait and gains 5 (`2d4`) temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns. This blessing lasts for 1 minute, until the treefolk has the [[incapacitated]] condition, or until the treefolk uses this bonus action again.
