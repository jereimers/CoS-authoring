## Actions

**Multiattack.** The matter smith makes two Manifested Force attacks.

**Manifested Force.** Attack (ms,rs) +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) force damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Planar Smithing.** The matter smith magically manipulates the energy of the plane of existence it's on to produce one of the following effects (choose one or roll a `d4`):

- **1-2: Chains:** The matter smith creates spectral bindings around a creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[restrained]] condition until the end of its next turn.
- **3-4: Magic Shield:** The matter smith conjures a floating, spectral shield that grants the matter smith a +5 bonus to its AC until the shield disappears at the start of the matter smith's next turn. The first time a creature misses a melee attack roll against the matter smith while the shield is conjured, that creature takes 7 (**2d6**) force damage.
