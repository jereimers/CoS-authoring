# Lightning Strikes

Whenever an area of the Calim Desert is subjected to both strong wind and heavy precipitation (see the [[Calim Desert Weather table|FRAiF]]), there is a 25 percent chance a lightning storm forms. Creatures within the area of such a storm are at risk of lightning strikes.

A lightning storm lasts for 1 hour. After each minute spent in the area of a lightning storm, a creature rolls **{@dice 1d6**}; on a 1, lightning streaks down to strike the creature. The creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking **{@dice 3d10**} Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Detecting Lightning Storms

A creature that succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ([[Nature|XPHB]]) or Wisdom ([[Survival|XPHB]]) check predicts a lightning storm **{@dice 1d4**} hours before it forms in the vicinity.
