# Talisman of the Sphere

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

When you make an Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) check to control a [[sphere of annihilation]] while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a [[sphere of annihilation]], you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 × your Intelligence modifier.
