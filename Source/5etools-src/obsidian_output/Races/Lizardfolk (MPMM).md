# Lizardfolk

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** walk 30 ft., swim (equal to walking)  

## Speed

Your walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

## Bite

You have a fanged maw that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, the strike deals **1d6** + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

## Hold Breath

You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.

## Hungry Jaws

You can throw yourself into a feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your Bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Natural Armor

You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your base AC is 13 + Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.

## Nature's Intuition

Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: [[Animal Handling]], [[Medicine]], [[Nature]], [[Perception]], [[Stealth]], or [[Survival]].
