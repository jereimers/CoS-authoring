## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**War Magic.** When the drow uses its action to cast a spell, it can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drow makes three scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) poison damage. In addition, the target has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell the drow casts before the end of the drow's next turn.

**Hand Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +11 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [[unconscious]] while [[poisoned]] in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.
