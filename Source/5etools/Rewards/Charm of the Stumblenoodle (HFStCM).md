# Charm of the Stumblenoodle

*Charm*

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you moves, you can use your reaction to give the creature the [[prone]] condition. Allies of the target who are within 30 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the end of their next turn as they laugh uncontrollably at their friend's misfortune. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
