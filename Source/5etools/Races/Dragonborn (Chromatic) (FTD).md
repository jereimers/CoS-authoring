# Dragonborn (Chromatic)

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Chromatic Ancestry

You have a chromatic dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Chromatic Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table.

**Chromatic Ancestry**

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|---|---|
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| White | Cold |

## Breath Weapon

When you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes **1d10** damage of the type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by **1d10** when you reach 5th level (**2d10**), 11th level (**3d10**), and 17th level (**4d10**).

You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Draconic Resistance

You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry.

## Chromatic Warding

Starting at 5th level, as an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
