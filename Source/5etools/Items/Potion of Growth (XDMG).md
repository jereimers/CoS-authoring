# Potion of Growth

*Item, Uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [[Enlarge/Reduce|XPHB]] spell for 10 minutes (no [[Concentration]] required).

The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
