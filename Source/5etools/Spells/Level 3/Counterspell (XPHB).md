# Counterspell

*3rd-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction (which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of yourself casting a spell with Verbal, Somatic, or Material components)  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], or [[Reaction|XPHB]] used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't expended.
