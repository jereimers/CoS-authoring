# Banishing Smite

*5th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus (which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Melee weapon or an {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB})  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The target hit by the attack roll takes an extra **5d10** Force damage from the attack. If the attack reduces the target to 50 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] or fewer, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
