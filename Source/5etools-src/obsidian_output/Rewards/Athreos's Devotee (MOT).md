*Piety Trait*

*Piety 3+ Athreos trait*

Your life is intertwined with the fate of the dead. You can cast [[gentle repose]] with this trait, requiring no material components, a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
