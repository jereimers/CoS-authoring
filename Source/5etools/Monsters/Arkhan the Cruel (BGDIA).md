## Traits

**Aura of Hate.** While Arkhan isn't [[incapacitated]], he and all fiends and undead within 30 feet of him deal 4 extra damage whenever they hit with a melee weapon attack (already factored into Arkhan's attacks). This extra damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage type.

**Hand of Vecna.** The [[Hand of Vecna]] has 8 charges and regains `1d4 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. Arkhan can cast the following spells from the hand by expending the specified number of charges (spell save DC 18): [[finger of death]] (5 charges), [[sleep]] (1 charge), [[slow]] (2 charges), and [[teleport]] (3 charges).

**Special Equipment.** Arkhan wields [[Fane-Eater|BGDIA]] and wears a suit of [[Obsidian Flint Dragon Plate|BGDIA]]. The armor gives Arkhan advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to avoid or end the [[grappled]] condition on him.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Arkhan makes three weapon attacks.

**Fane-Eater (Battleaxe).** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**1d8 + 12**) slashing damage, or 17 (**1d10 + 12**) slashing damage when used with two hands, plus 9 (**2d8**) cold damage. If the target is a creature and Arkhan rolls a 20 on the attack roll, the creature takes an extra 9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage, and Arkhan regains an amount of hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) piercing damage, plus 4 piercing damage and 9 (**2d8**) cold damage if the javelin was used to make a melee attack.
