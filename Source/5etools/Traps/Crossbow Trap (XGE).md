# Crossbow Trap

The crossbow trap is a favorite of kobolds and other creatures that rely on traps to defend their lairs. It consists of a trip wire strung across a hallway and connected to a pair of hidden heavy crossbows. The crossbows are aimed to fire down the hallway at anyone who disturbs the trip wire.
