# Who They Were/Are

Khazan was (or is) an archmage of considerable power who lived in [[Barovia]]. His fate remains unknown to the party.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Victor Vallakovich]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

## Khazan's Spellbook

- Victor found Khazan's spellbook in the [[DM Wiki/Entities/Areas/Town of Vallaki/Burgomaster's Mansion|Vallakovich Manor]] library several years ago
- The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] never noticed it was missing
- The spellbook bears Khazan's personal sigil on its cover: an intricate symbol combining arcane elements
- Victor has been using it to teach himself magic, since his father refused to hire him a proper tutor
- The spellbook contains advanced magical knowledge, including information about the [[Ethereal Plane]]

## Khazan's Sigil

The platinum ring found at the site of [[Arabelle]]'s abduction bears the same sigil as Khazan's spellbook:
- Two intertwined symbols representing necromancy and evocation schools of magic
- [[Kasimir Velikov]] identified the magical schools but couldn't identify whose sigil it was
- The ring's presence at the crime scene suggests whoever abducted Arabelle may be connected to Khazan or his works

## Khazan's Tower

Victor revealed that Khazan built a wizard's tower on [[Lake Baratok]], west of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]:

- The tower sits at the end of a gravel causeway extending into the lake
- Khazan imbued it with powerful enchantments
- Most notably, the tower has a protective field that prevents other spellcasters from using magic within its influence
- This anti-magic security measure makes the tower incredibly difficult to breach
- Victor has asked the party to explore the tower and bring back any magical artifacts or tomes they find

## Books by Khazan

Victor has access to at least one book authored by or belonging to Khazan:
- *Ethereal Entities: Denizens of the Unseen Realm* - Contains a ritual that can temporarily transport living creatures into the [[Ethereal Plane]]
- The ritual requires a [[Night Hags|night hag]]'s [[Heartstone|heartstone]] and must be performed on the night of the full moon

# Significance

Khazan's magical knowledge and artifacts have become central to multiple mysteries:
- His sigil's appearance at Arabelle's abduction site
- His tower potentially holding clues about the abduction
- His books containing the ritual needed to rescue [[Stella Wachter]]'s soul

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Raiding the Vallakovich Library (Politely)|Session 13]] — [[Victor Vallakovich]] revealed Khazan's spellbook and explained about the tower on [[Lake Baratok]]
- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Victor's Workroom|Session 13]] — Victor explained that Khazan's books contain the ritual needed to enter the [[Ethereal Plane]]
