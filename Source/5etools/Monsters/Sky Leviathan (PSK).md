## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d8 + 9**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the leviathan. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the leviathan, and it takes 21 (**6d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the leviathan's turns.

If the leviathan takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the leviathan must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the leviathan. If the leviathan dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
