# Kenku

**Size:** Small, Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Size

Your size is Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

## Expert Duplication

When you copy writing or craftwork produced by yourself or someone else, you have advantage on any ability checks you make to produce an exact duplicate.

## Kenku Recall

Thanks to your supernaturally good memory, you have proficiency in two skills of your choice.

Moreover, when you make an ability check using any skill in which you have proficiency, you can give yourself advantage on the check before rolling the `d20`. You can give yourself advantage in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Mimicry

You can accurately mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations only with a successful Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.
