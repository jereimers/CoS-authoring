## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the neogi's darkvision.

**Mental Fortitude.** The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]], and magic can't put the neogi to sleep.

**Spider Climb.** The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The neogi makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it makes two Eldritch Bolt attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Eldritch Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h20 (**3d10 + 4**) force damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The neogi targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[charmed]] by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The [[charmed]] target obeys the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 1 mile. Whenever the [[charmed]] target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
