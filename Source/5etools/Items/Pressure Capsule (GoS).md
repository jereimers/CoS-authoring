# Pressure Capsule

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This small capsule is made of beeswax blended with sand and a variety of enchanted water plants. A creature who consumes a pressure capsule ignores the effects of swimming at depths greater than 100 feet (see "[[Unusual Environments|dmg]]" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
