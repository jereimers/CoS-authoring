## Traits

**Beast of Burden.** The ox is considered to be one size larger for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity.


## Actions

**Gore.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) piercing damage. If the ox moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 7 (**2d6**) piercing damage, and it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.
