# Svirfneblin Magic

**Prerequisites:** gnome

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [[nondetection]] on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [[blindness/deafness]], [[blur]], and [[disguise self]]. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.
