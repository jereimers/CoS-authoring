## Traits

**Terror Frenzy (Fury Only).** The spirit has advantage on attack rolls against [[frightened]] creatures.

**Weight of Sorrow (Despair Only).** Any creature, other than you, that starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit has its speed reduced by 20 feet until the start of that creature's next turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spirit makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

**Chilling Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack @hitYourSpellAttack to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h**1d12 + 3 + summonSpellLevel** cold damage.

**Dreadful Scream (1/Day).** The spirit screams. Each creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Bonus Actions

**Shadow Stealth (Fear Only).** While in dim light or darkness, the spirit takes the Hide action.
