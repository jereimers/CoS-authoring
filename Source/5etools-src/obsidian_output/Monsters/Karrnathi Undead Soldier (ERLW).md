## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** The soldier has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the soldier's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the soldier to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the soldier drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The soldier attacks three times with one of its weapons.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) slashing damage, or 8 (**1d10 + 3**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** The soldier adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the soldier must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
