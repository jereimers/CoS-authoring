## Traits

**Inscrutable.** No magic can observe the sphinx remotely or detect its thoughts without its permission. Wisdom ([[Insight|XPHB]]) checks made to ascertain its intentions or sincerity are made with [[Disadvantage|XPHB]].

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).** If the sphinx fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sphinx makes two Claw attacks and uses Roar.

**Claw.** m +12, reach 5 ft. @h20 (**4d6 + 6**) Slashing damage.

**Roar (3/Day).** The sphinx emits a magical roar. Whenever it roars, the roar has a different effect, as detailed below (the sequence resets when it takes a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]):

- **First Roar:** wis DC 20, each enemy in a 500-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the sphinx. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute.
- **Second Roar:** wis DC 20, each enemy in a 500-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the sphinx. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition, and it repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
- **Third Roar:** con DC 20, each enemy in a 500-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the sphinx. @actSaveFail 44 (**8d10**) Thunder damage, and the target has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Arcane Prowl.** The sphinx can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see, and it makes one Claw attack.

**Weight of Years.** con DC 16, one creature the sphinx can see within 120 feet. @actSaveFail The target gains 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level. While the target has any [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] levels, it appears `3d10` years older. @actSaveSuccessOrFail The sphinx can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.
