## Traits

**Trampling Charge.** If the gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is [[prone]], the gorgon can make one attack with its hooves against it as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Gore.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h18 (**2d12 + 5**) piercing damage.

**Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Petrifying Breath {@recharge 5}.** The gorgon exhales petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is [[restrained]]. The [[restrained]] target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is [[petrified]] until freed by the  [[greater restoration]] spell or other magic.
