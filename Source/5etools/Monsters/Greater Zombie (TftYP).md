## Traits

**Turn Resistance.** The zombie has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The zombie makes two melee attacks.

**Empowered Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage and 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage.
