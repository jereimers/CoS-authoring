## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) poison damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Change Shape.** The dragon magically transforms into any creature that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses its action to end it.

**Nightmare Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a cloud of spores in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 33 (**6d10**) psychic damage, and it is [[frightened]] of the dragon for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Commanding Spores.** The dragon releases spores around a creature within 30 feet of it that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against a random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, or the target can't take a reaction, it takes 5 (**1d10**) psychic damage.

**Tail.** The dragon makes one Tail attack.

**Spore Salvo (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon releases poisonous spores around a creature within 30 feet of it that it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 17 (**5d6**) poison damage and become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The [[poisoned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
