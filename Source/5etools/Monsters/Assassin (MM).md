## Traits

**Assassinate.** During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a [[surprised]] creature is a critical hit.

**Evasion.** If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** The assassin deals an extra 14 (**4d6**) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't [[incapacitated]] and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (**7d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (**7d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
