## Traits

**Acidic Attacks.** If a creature takes acid damage from the miasmorne and that creature is wearing nonmagical metal armor, that armor is destroyed.

**Acidic Hide.** After a nonmagical metal weapon hits the miasmorne that weapon melts and is destroyed. Likewise, nonmagical metal ammunition that hits the miasmorne is destroyed.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The miasmorne makes three attacks using Bite, Flechette or a combination of the two.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (**2d6**) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 18). The miasmorne can't make Bite attacks while a creature is [[grappled]] in this way.

**Flechette.** Ranged Weapon Attack +11 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) acid damage.

**Flechette Spray {@recharge 5}.** The miasmorne launches flechettes from its fins in a 90-foot cone in front of it. All creatures in the cone must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (**6d6**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Acidic Secretion (1/Day).** The miasmorne secretes an acidic solution, then sprays it around itself. All creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere, centered on the miasmorne, must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. Targets take 26 (**4d12**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. All nonmagical metals within the radius that aren't being carried, as well as nonmagical metal items carried or worn by creatures that failed the save, are destroyed.
