# Wrathful Smite

*1st-level necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus (which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Melee weapon or an {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB})  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** 1 minute

The target takes an extra **1d6** Necrotic damage from the attack, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the [[Frightened|XPHB]] target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
