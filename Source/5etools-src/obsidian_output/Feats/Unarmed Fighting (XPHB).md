# Unarmed Fighting

When you hit with your [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]] and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to **1d6** plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]]. If you aren't holding any weapons or a [[Shield|XPHB]] when you make the attack roll, the `d6` becomes a `d8`.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal **1d4** Bludgeoning damage to one creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by you.
