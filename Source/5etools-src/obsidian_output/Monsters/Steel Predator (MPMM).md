## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The steel predator has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unusual Nature.** The steel predator doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The steel predator makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h18 (**2d10 + 7**) lightning damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) force damage.

**Stunning Roar {@recharge 5}.** The steel predator emits a roar in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (**6d10**) thunder damage, drops everything it's holding, and is [[stunned]] for 1 minute. The [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[stunned]].
