## Traits

**Awakening of the Scion.** The cradle is a container for the [[scion of Skoraeus|BGG]]. When the cradle drops to 0 hit points, its body crumbles to dust. The scion instantly appears in the space the cradle occupied and uses the cradle's initiative count.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If the cradle fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The cradle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The cradle deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cradle makes two Slam or Spit Rock attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h30 (**4d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.

**Spit Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h24 (**3d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Shattering Roar {@recharge 5}.** The cradle lets out a painfully load roar. Each creature within 60 feet of the cradle must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (**6d10**) thunder damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Crystal Flare.** The cradle causes the crystals on its body to flare with light. Each creature within 30 feet of the cradle must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (**6d6**) radiant damage and have the [[blinded]] condition until the end of the cradle's next turn.

**Stone Spikes.** The cradle causes the ground in a 20-foot square within 90 feet of itself to sprout crystal spikes until the start of its next turn. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. A creature takes 10 (**3d6**) piercing damage for each 5 feet it moves on this terrain.
