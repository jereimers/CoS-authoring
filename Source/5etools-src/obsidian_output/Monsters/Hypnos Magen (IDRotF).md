## Traits

**Fiery End.** If the magen dies, its body disintegrates in a harmless burst of fire and smoke, leaving behind anything it was wearing or carrying.

**Magic Resistance.** The magen has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unusual Nature.** The magen doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Psychic Lash.** The magen's eyes glow silver as it targets one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or take 11 (**2d10**) psychic damage.

**Suggestion.** The magen casts the [[suggestion]] spell (save DC 12), requiring no material components. The target must be a creature that the magen can communicate with telepathically. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the target is immune to this magen's [[suggestion]] spell for the next 24 hours. The magen's spellcasting ability is Intelligence.
