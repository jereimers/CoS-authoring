# Thunderwave

*1st-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (15-feet cube)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **2d8** Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `2d8` for each spell slot level above 1.
