# Frigid Water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level. Creatures with [[Resistance|XPHB]] or [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.
