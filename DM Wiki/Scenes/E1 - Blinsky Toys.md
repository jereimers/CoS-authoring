# Things to describe

## Creepy Toys
#### Creepy Toys

Blinsky believes the burgomaster is right-that the only way to escape from Barovia is to make everyone in town "hyappy." Blinsky would like to do his part by making sure that all the children in Barovia have fun toys. On display are a few of his creations:

- A headless doll that comes with a sack of attachable heads, including one with its eyes and mouth stitched shut (price 9 cp )
- A miniature gallows, complete with trapdoor and a weighted "hanged man" (price 9 cp )
- A set of wooden nesting dolls; the smaller each one gets, the older it gets, until the innermost doll is a mummified corpse (price 9 cp )
- A wood-and-string mobile of hanging bats with flapping wings (price 9 cp )
- A wind-up musical merry-go-round with figures of snarling wolves chasing children in place of prancing horses (price 9 sp )
- A ventriloquist's dummy that looks like Strahd von Zarovich (price 9 sp )
- A doll that looks remarkably like [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] (not for sale; see below)

# Blinsky's Lines
**Greeting:** "Wyelcome, friends, to the House of Blinsky, where hyappiness and smiles can be bought at bargain prices. Perhaps you know a leetle child in need of joy? A leetle toy for a girl or boy?"

**Rambling:** As the characters explore the shop, Blinsky cheerfully tells them about his inspiration for making toys: the legendary toymaker Fritz von Weerg, and his greatest invention that was lost to the ages: a clockwork man said to lie somewhere in Castle Ravenloft.

**If Ireena doll is asked about:** he anxiously insists that it is not for sale and asks them to choose another toy. If the players demand an explanation for its eerie resemblance, they can coax a fearful Blinsky to share what he knows with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion or Intimidation) check or by taking the doll for themselves. Blinsky is clearly terrified of Izek’s wrath, and will do anything to ensure that the doll is delivered on time.

**If they ask about Piccolo:** If the players ask Blinsky about Piccolo, he can inform them that he received the monkey just over three months ago, from a traveling scholar named Alanik Ray.
