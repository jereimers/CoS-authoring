# Child of the Sun

You gain the following benefits.

## Eyes of Eirdu

You and allies within 10 feet of you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws made to avoid or end the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition.

## Faerie Fire

You learn the [[Faerie Fire|XPHB]] spell. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat). You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

When you cast [[Faerie Fire|XPHB]] without a spell slot using this benefit, taking damage can't break your [[Concentration]] on the spell.
