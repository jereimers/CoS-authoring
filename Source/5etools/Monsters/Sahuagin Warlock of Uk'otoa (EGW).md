## Traits

**Blood Frenzy.** The warlock has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

**Limited Amphibiousness.** The warlock can breathe air and water, but it needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.

**Shark Telepathy.** The warlock can magically command any shark within 120 feet of it, using a limited telepathy.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The warlock makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its Sword of Fathoms.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Sword of Fathoms.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) slashing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or begin choking. The choking creature is [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn, when the effect ends on it.

**Eldritch Blast (Cantrip).** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h5 (**1d10**) force damage.
