## Traits

**Death Throes.** When the draconian is reduced to 0 hit points, its scales and flesh immediately shrivel away and its bones explode. Each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (**2d8**) force damage.

**Glide.** When the draconian falls and isn't [[incapacitated]], it subtracts up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating the fall's damage, and it can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The draconian makes two Trident or Necrotic Ray attacks.

**Trident.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage, or 6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Necrotic Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack +4 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage.
