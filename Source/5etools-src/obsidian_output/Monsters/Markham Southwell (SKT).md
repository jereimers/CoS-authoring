Ideal: "All people deserve to be treated with dignity."

Bond: "Duvessa is a natural leader, but she needs help. That's my job."

Flaw: "I bury my emotions and have no interest in small talk."

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) slashing damage, or 7 (**1d10 + 2**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +3 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d10 + 1**) piercing damage. Markham carries twenty crossbow bolts.
