# Who they are

A figure stands alone with the bearing of one who knows no fear. Clad in rusty armor, it clutches a gleaming longsword in its pale hand and looks ready for a fight.

From a distance, the revenant looks like a zombie and might be mistaken for such. Only the cool hatred in its eyes belies its intelligence. The revenant is clad in tattered chain mail that affords the same protection as leather armor.

This revenant has forgotten its name, and you gave it one: Standimir. 

# What the party knows

- The revenant was a knight of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]], which was annihilated defending the valley against Strahd's armies centuries ago. The revenant no longer remembers its name and wanders the land in search of Strahd's wolves and other minions, slaying them on sight.
- Standimir was banished from [[Argynvostholt]] because he "raised his voice against his commander." His commander, named [[Commander Vladimir Horngaard]], has also forbade him and the other members of the order from raising arms against Strahd or his minions.
- He recognized the silver pendant found at the ruined watchtower, but could not comment further. 
- [[Choppy Gibbles|Choppy]] asked him about the "amber doors" mentioned by [[Madam Eva]] in her [[The Tarokka Reading|Tarokka reading]]. He stiffened, then warned him "not to meddle with things that ought not be meddled with." He would share no more than that, stating he "was bound never to reveal the secrets of that which he once guarded."
- About the [[Session 07 - The Tarokka Reading#The Skeletal Rider|skeletal rider]] you encountered, he said that "the Wandering One seeks a road to freedom through the mists. It will never succeed."
- He urged the party to travel to Argynvostholt, in the west, and speak to [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]] if they truly wished to take up arms against [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. 
- As he bade farewell, he warned against "those who walk in the skins of wolves... Once, they did not trouble those who traveled the roads," he rasped. "Something has changed, however, and now, their hunger for human flesh cannot be sated."
# Personality

He could've been a cool dude before he forgot who he was. Or maybe he was a jerk. 

# Where we've seen them

- [[Session 08 - Hairy Bill, Bairy Hill, and a Coin for the Ladies Three#Tser Falls and the Standimir Revenant 's Counsel|Session 8]]
