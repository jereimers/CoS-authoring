If the characters reach area $H$ by following the footpath from the Vistani encampment (area G), read:

You follow the river to the base of a canyon, at the far end of which a great waterfall spills into a pool, billowing forth clouds of cold mist. A great stone bridge spans the canyon nearly one thousand feet overhead.

If the characters are on the high road instead, read:

You follow the dirt road as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of mold-encrusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog-shrouded pines that blanket the valley.

The chasm's walls are slippery and sheer, and can't be scaled without the aid of magic or a climber's kit.
The bridge is slick with moisture but safe to cross. The road south of the bridge leads down the mountainside to area F; the road north cuts through the mountains to area I.

The gargoyles on the bridge are harmless sculptures.
