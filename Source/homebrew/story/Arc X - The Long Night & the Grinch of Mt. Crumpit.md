# Arc X: The Long Night & the Grinch of Mt. Crumpit

_An adventure for four 4th-level characters._

In this arc, the players become aware of a mysterious figure stalking the streets of Vallaki—a creature the children whisper about, a "Green Devil" who dwells atop the crooked peak of Mt. Crumpit. As the winter solstice approaches and Vallaki prepares for the Long Night—a fragile observance of hope in the darkness—the players must decide whether to investigate the mountain, confront its bitter inhabitant, or allow an ancient cycle of theft and despair to continue unchecked.

What begins as a simple investigation into stolen toys becomes a choice between violence and compassion, between destroying a monster and redeeming a broken soul. Can the players see past the Grinch's cruelty to the loneliness beneath? Or will they become yet another reason for him to hate the world?

> [!lore]+ **The Grinch's Origins** 
> The Grinch's true origins are lost to time and the Mists—perhaps deliberately so. He claims to remember a toymaker's workshop in a town that no longer exists, a rival who surpassed him, a community that mocked his creations. But these memories shift and contradict themselves. Did he enter Barovia as a mortal and become twisted by the Mists? Was he created by them whole cloth, a manifestation of bitter isolation? Or is he something older, wearing the shape of a man?
> 
> What is certain: the Grinch has dwelt atop Mt. Crumpit for decades, sustained by the Mists and his own bitterness. The mountain itself exists in a localized Mist-pocket—a demi-refuge similar to the Abbey of Saint Markovia—where reality bends to the emotions of its master. Time flows strangely there; the cold is sharper; joy withers.
> 
> The Grinch is not undead, not fey, not fiend. He is simply... a man who has lived too long in darkness, who has forgotten what it means to be part of something larger than himself. The Mists have preserved him, amplified his worst qualities, and given him just enough power to make his isolation comfortable.
> 
> But isolation breeds bitterness, and bitterness breeds cruelty. For years, the Grinch has watched Vallaki from his mountain, observing their festivals, their forced cheer, their desperate attempts to cling to hope. And every year on the Long Night, he descends to take it all away.
> 
> _**Max's Purpose.**_ The Grinch crafted Max years ago from salvaged parts, enchantments, and something he refuses to name aloud: loneliness. Max is a construct, a steel defender given the shape of a dog and imbued with just enough sentience to be loyal. The Grinch tells himself Max is a tool, a guardian, a pack mule. He is lying.
> 
> Max is the Grinch's only companion, his only confidant, his only source of unconditional affection. And deep down, beneath layers of cynicism and self-loathing, the Grinch knows that if anything happened to Max, the last fragile tether connecting him to empathy would snap.
> ^Lore-The-Grinchs-Origins

# X1. Whispers in the Town Square

<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N8.</em></span>

The players first hear of the Grinch through rumor and story, either by observing Vallakian children or by speaking with worried adults. This scene can occur at any time after the players have spent at least one day in Vallaki, but works best when placed during a quieter moment—after a tense encounter, when the players are catching their breath in the relative safety of the town.

## X1a. The Children's Song

If the players spend time in the town square (N8. Town Square, p. 119), they can observe a group of five Vallakian children (human noncombatants aged 6-10) playing a counting game. The children hold hands in a circle and skip in rhythm as they chant:

<div class="description" style="text-align: center;"> <p>One, two, he's watching you,</p> <p>Three, four, lock your door,</p> <p>Five, six, he's full of tricks,</p> <p>Seven, eight, don't celebrate,</p> <p>Nine, ten, he'll come again!</p> </div>

On the final line, the children scatter with delighted shrieks, playing at being chased by an invisible monster.

If the players approach or ask about the song, the children respond with a mix of excitement and unease:

- The song is about "the Green Man" or "the Green Devil" who lives on the crooked mountain (Mt. Crumpit, visible to the northwest on clear days).
- He steals toys from children who are too happy or who celebrate too loudly.
- He has a dog with "eyes like dying embers" that watches the town at night.
- If you see the dog, you should run, because the Green Man isn't far behind.
- Some children claim to have seen him on the Long Night, creeping through the streets with a giant sack.

The children speak in the half-believing, half-mocking tone of young people who aren't sure if a story is real. The older children (ages 9-10) insist it's just a tale to scare babies; the younger ones (ages 6-7) seem genuinely frightened.

If pressed about whether the Green Man is real, the children argue among themselves. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that even the skeptical children aren't entirely sure—there's a kernel of genuine fear beneath their bravado.

> [!profile]+ **Profile: The Vallakian Children**
> 
> **Roleplaying Information** 
> _**Resonance.**_ The children should inspire sympathy with their mixture of innocence and fear, amusement with their childish arguments, and unease with the casual way they discuss monsters.
> 
> _**Emotions.**_ The children most often feel playful, frightened, curious, argumentative, or defensive.
> 
> _**Motivations.**_ The children want to seem brave in front of their peers, to avoid punishment from adults for spreading "disturbing stories," and—quietly—to know if the Green Man is real.
> 
> _**Inspirations.**_ When playing the children, channel the kids from _IT_, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo (_Scooby-Doo_), and the Goonies (_The Goonies_).
> 
> **Character Information** 
> _**Persona.**_ To strangers, the children are loud, excitable, and prone to exaggeration. To those they trust, they are genuinely worried about the Long Night and the possibility that the stories might be true.
> 
> _**Morale.**_ In danger, the children would flee immediately, screaming for help from adults.
> 
> _**Relationships.**_ The children know and fear the town guards, admire [[Gadof Blinsky]] for his toys (despite finding him strange), and universally dread the Long Night raids that leave their families bereft of gifts and decorations.
> ^Profile-Vallakian-Children

## X1b. Adult Concerns

If the players speak with adult Vallakians about the children's song or about Mt. Crumpit, they receive more measured (but no less contradictory) responses:

- **Shopkeepers and Commoners:** Most dismiss the stories as superstition. "Children will believe anything," they say, though some admit to keeping their shutters locked on the Long Night "just in case."
- **Town Guards:** Guards are more circumspect. They've seen lights on the mountain. They've heard the Mists behave strangely near the old standing stones halfway up the slope. [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] has forbidden them from investigating, calling it a waste of resources.
- **[[Gadof Blinsky]]:** If the players visit Blinsky Toys (N7. Blinsky Toys, p. 118), Blinsky himself can share that he's had items stolen from his shop in the past—toys, decorations, tools. "Is no good, is no Blinsky!" he laments. He suspects "some creature" but has no proof. If the players seem interested in investigating, he perks up hopefully.
- _**Father Lucian.**_ If the players ask [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] about the Grinch at St. Andral's Church (N1. St. Andral's Church, p. 97), he sighs and admits that the stories have persisted for decades. "Whether the creature is real or merely a convenient scapegoat for petty theft, I cannot say," he says quietly. "But I have counseled families who lost their Long Night gifts to... _something_. And I have seen the wounds left on hearts when hope is stolen."

## X1c. The Baron's Response

If the players bring up the Grinch stories with [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] (N3. Burgomaster's Mansion, p. 103), he dismisses them with barely concealed irritation:

- "Peasant superstition! There is no 'Green Devil.' Such defeatist thinking undermines the morale of my festivals."
- "I have forbidden the guards from wasting time on such foolishness. They have real threats to address."
- If pressed, he admits that "certain items" have gone missing on past Long Nights, but attributes this to common thieves taking advantage of the celebrations.
- He forbids the players from "indulging these rumors" if they wish to remain in good standing in Vallaki.

A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that the Baron is lying—not about his belief (he genuinely thinks the stories are nonsense), but about his confidence. There's a flicker of unease in his eyes when he mentions the Long Night.

# X2. The Theft at Blinsky's Toys

<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N7.</em></span>

Several nights before the Long Night (or at any dramatically appropriate time if the players have not yet heard of the Grinch), [[Gadof Blinsky]]'s toy shop is robbed. The theft is not catastrophic—Blinsky's business survives—but it is distressing, and it provides the players with their first concrete evidence that something unusual is happening.

## X2a. Discovery

The players learn of the theft through one of the following means:

- **Direct Observation:** If the players visit Blinsky Toys the morning after the theft, they find Blinsky distressed, surrounded by scattered tools and empty shelves.
- **Rumor:** Townspeople gossip about the incident in the Blue Water Inn (N2. Blue Water Inn, p. 98) or the town square.
- **Request:** Blinsky seeks out the players directly, having heard they are "adventurers," and begs for their help recovering his stolen goods.
- Blinsky seeks out Rictavio, who is dining in the taproom of The Blue Water Inn in the morning after the theft occurs. 
- **Baron's Complaint:** The Baron summons the players to his mansion, raging about missing festival decorations that Blinsky was supposed to deliver. (The decorations were among the stolen items.)

When the players first see Blinsky after the theft, read:

<div class="description"> <p>Blinsky's Toys is usually a place of morbid whimsy—wind-up skeletons, weeping dolls, tiny gallows. Today, however, the shop's macabre charm is overshadowed by genuine distress.</p> <p>Gadof Blinsky sits amid scattered tools and half-empty shelves, his ridiculous jester's cap askew, his face pale. "Is no good," he mumbles when he sees you, wringing his hands. "All gone. The toys, the decorations for the Baron's festival—taken in the night."</p> <p>He gestures helplessly at his ransacked workshop. "But who? Who would steal toys? And why? What kind of monster does such a thing?"</p> </div>

## X2b. What Blinsky Knows

If the players question Blinsky, he can share the following information:

- The theft occurred sometime after midnight, while he was asleep upstairs.
- He heard nothing during the robbery—"Whoever it was, they moved like a ghost."
- In the morning, he found his shop ransacked: toys stolen from shelves, tools and materials taken from his workshop, and several festival decorations (commissioned by the Baron) missing.
- He discovered strange claw marks on the windowsill—"Not like any animal I recognize. Too deliberate."
- Muddy pawprints trail from the back door toward the rear alley—"Like a dog, but... wrong somehow. Too precise."

If the players ask whether he suspects anyone, Blinsky hesitates, then admits: "The children, they tell stories. About a creature on the mountain. The 'Green Man,' they call him. I always thought it was foolishness, but... those claw marks..." He trails off, unwilling to voice the possibility aloud.

Blinsky is terrified that the Baron will blame him for losing the decorations, and he pleads with the players to help him recover the stolen goods—or at least find out who took them. He offers the following reward:

- 50 gp (his life savings, offered tearfully)
- A custom Blinsky toy for each party member
- Free repairs to any equipment (his skills are modest but sincere)
- Eternal gratitude and friendship

> [!abstract]+ **Blinsky's Emotional State** 
> Blinsky is genuinely distraught. This is not merely a financial loss—though that is significant—but a personal violation. He takes pride in his work, macabre though it may be, and the thought that someone despises it enough to steal it wounds him deeply.
> 
> If the players are kind to him, Blinsky becomes a loyal ally. If they dismiss his concerns or refuse to help, he retreats into melancholy and becomes less cooperative in future interactions.
> ^Abstract-Blinskys-Emotional-State

## X2c. Investigating the Scene

If the players examine Blinsky's shop for clues, they can discover the following with successful ability checks:

_**Claw Marks on Windowsill (DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)).**_ The marks are present and clearly visible—deep gouges in the wood, made by something with long, claw-like nails. They are not the marks of a common animal; the spacing and depth suggest something humanoid.

_**Claw Analysis (DC 14 Wisdom (Nature or Survival)).**_ The claw marks were made by a humanoid with elongated nails, not a beast. The marks are deliberate, not frenzied—whoever made them was methodical, not panicked.

_**Pawprints (DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)).**_ Muddy pawprints are visible on the floor near the back door and continue into the rear alley. They are dog-like in shape—four-toed, with distinct pad marks—but unusually regular, almost mechanical in their precision.

_**Pawprint Analysis (DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation)).**_ The pawprints are too uniform to belong to a natural dog. Each print is nearly identical in depth and spacing, suggesting either an exceptionally well-trained animal or something... else. A player proficient in Arcana recognizes that the prints might belong to a construct.

_**Lock Examination (DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation)).**_ The lock on the back door was picked, not forced. The scratches around the keyhole are consistent with crude lockpicks or improvised tools. Whoever broke in had some skill, but not professional expertise—more clever than trained.

_**Residue on Floor (DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)).**_ A faint frost residue clings to the floorboards near the window, even though the shop's interior is above freezing. The frost is not natural condensation—it feels wrong, as though it came from somewhere colder than the Barovian winter.

_**Missing Items Pattern (DC 13 Wisdom (Insight)).**_ A review of what was stolen reveals a strange pattern: the thief prioritized symbolic items (toys, decorations, gifts) over more valuable goods. Blinsky's cashbox, though in plain sight, was left untouched. This was not a theft for profit—it was a theft of _meaning_.

## X2d. Following the Trail

If the players choose to follow the pawprints from Blinsky's shop, they can track them through Vallaki and out toward Mt. Crumpit with a series of successful Wisdom (Survival) checks:

_**Back Alley (DC 12 Wisdom (Survival)).**_ The trail is easy to follow initially. The muddy prints lead northwest through Vallaki's back alleys, past slumbering houses and shuttered shops, avoiding the main streets. The thief knew the town's layout.

_**Town Wall (DC 14 Wisdom (Perception)).**_ The trail ends at Vallaki's northwest wall. Scuff marks on the stone show where something climbed over—first the humanoid, then the dog. The wall is eight feet high; climbing it would require either a Strength (Athletics) check (DC 12) or climbing gear.

_**Outside the Wall (DC 12 Wisdom (Survival)).**_ Beyond the wall, the prints continue into the snow, two sets now clearly visible: one humanoid, one canine. They head unerringly toward the crooked silhouette on the horizon—Mt. Crumpit, wreathed in Mist, waiting.

_**Trail Quality (DC 14 Wisdom (Survival)).**_ The tracks are several hours old but still fresh enough to follow. Both sets of prints move with purpose, not haste—the thief was confident, not fleeing. If the players continue tracking, the trail leads directly to the base of Mt. Crumpit. (Proceed to [[#A3. The Ascent]].)

### Optional: Witness Accounts

If the players ask around Vallaki for witnesses, they can find the following NPCs willing to share information:

- **Night Watchman (Town Guard):** A gruff **guard** stationed near the northwest gate admits he saw nothing during his watch, but felt "watched" around midnight. "Gave me the shivers," he says quietly. "Like something was staring at the back of my neck."
- **Stray Dog:** A local stray dog—a mangy mutt that usually roams the alleys—was found cowering under a porch the morning after the theft. It refuses to leave its hiding spot and growls at anyone who approaches. (A _speak with animals_ spell reveals the dog saw "a wrong dog" with "eyes that didn't blink" and fled in terror.)
- **Child Witness (Optional):** A Vallakian child (human noncombatant, age 8) claims to have seen "a dog with glowing eyes" from their bedroom window around 2 AM. Their parents dismissed it as a nightmare, but the child insists it was real. If the players are kind, the child also mentions seeing "a tall shadow" behind the dog—"Like a man, but wrong."

# X3. The Ascent

<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in a new location: Mt. Crumpit.</em></span>

Mt. Crumpit rises northwest of Vallaki, a jagged peak shrouded in perpetual mist. The journey from Vallaki's walls to the mountain's base is approximately **two miles** and takes roughly forty minutes on foot. The ascent itself—from base to summit—is far more arduous.

## X3a. Approaching the Mountain

As the players leave Vallaki's walls and approach Mt. Crumpit, read:

<div class="description"> <p>The path from Vallaki narrows as you leave the town behind, dwindling from a rutted road to a rocky trail barely wide enough for single file. The air grows colder with each step, the Mists thicker, until the town behind you is swallowed entirely by gray.</p> <p>Ahead, Mt. Crumpit rises like a broken tooth against the sky—crooked, jagged, and utterly inhospitable. The peak is wreathed in Mist that seems to cling to the stone with deliberate malice, swirling in patterns that suggest movement but reveal nothing.</p> <p>The silence here is absolute. No birds call; no wind stirs the dead grass. The only sound is the crunch of your boots on frozen earth... and, perhaps, the faint echo of something watching from above.</p> </div>

The journey from Vallaki to the base of Mt. Crumpit is uneventful—the Grinch's presence keeps predators away, and Strahd's servants avoid the area, sensing the Mist-pocket's strange resonance. However, the oppressive atmosphere should unsettle the players. Emphasize the cold, the silence, and the feeling of being observed.

### Environmental Details

- **Terrain:** Rocky, uneven ground with patches of ice-slicked stone. Not difficult terrain, but treacherous if the players are careless.
- **Weather:** Cold winds blow down from the mountain. Characters without cold weather gear must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw each hour or gain one level of exhaustion.
- **Visibility:** The Mists reduce visibility to 60 feet. Beyond that, the mountain is a gray blur.
- **Signs of Habitation:** As the players near the base of the mountain, they begin to notice signs that something lives here: claw marks on rocks, scattered mechanical parts (gears, springs, bent metal), and Max's pawprints in the snow.

## X3b. The Lower Slopes (1-2 Hours)

The lower slopes of Mt. Crumpit are steep but climbable. The path winds back and forth across the mountainside, switchbacking through dead scrub and over loose scree. Read:

<div class="description"> <p>The ascent begins in earnest. The path—if it can be called that—zigzags up the mountain's lower slopes, threading between boulders and over sheets of frost-slicked stone. Your breath comes in visible clouds; your fingers ache with cold.</p> <p>The mountain resents your presence. You feel it in the way the stones shift beneath your boots, the way the wind cuts straight through your cloaks, the way the Mists seem to press closer with every step. This is not a place meant for the living.</p> </div>

### Hazards

_**Cold Winds (Every Hour).**_ Characters without cold weather gear must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC increases by 1 for each subsequent hour spent on the mountain (DC 11 after 2 hours, DC 12 after 3 hours, etc.).

_**Loose Rocks (Random Encounter).**_ Every 30 minutes of travel, roll 1d6. On a 1, a player (chosen at random) dislodges a loose rock. That player must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage as rocks tumble down the slope. On a failure by 5 or more, the player also triggers a minor rockslide: all creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

_**Fatigue.**_ After 1 hour of climbing, each player must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion. (This is in addition to exhaustion from the cold.)

### Signs of the Grinch

As the players climb, they notice increasing evidence of the Grinch's presence:

- **Claw marks** gouged into rocks, as though something climbed here frequently.
- **Mechanical debris** scattered among the stones—gears, springs, coils of wire.
- **Max's pawprints**, perfectly spaced and eerily uniform, leading up the mountain.

A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that the humanoid tracks (claw marks) and canine tracks (pawprints) were made within the last 24 hours—the Grinch and Max recently descended to Vallaki and returned.

## X3c. The Steep Ascent (2-3 Hours)

Approximately halfway up the mountain, the path becomes nearly vertical. The players must now climb, not merely hike. Read:

<div class="description"> <p>The path vanishes entirely, replaced by a near-vertical rockface slick with ice. Above, you can see the faint outline of a ledge—perhaps fifty feet up—but reaching it will require more than determination. It will require strength, skill, and no small amount of luck.</p> <p>The wind howls here, tearing at your clothes and threatening to pry your fingers from the stone. Below, the Mists churn like a living thing, eager to swallow any who fall.</p> </div>

### Climbing Mechanics

To ascend the steep section, each player must succeed on a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check:

- **Success:** The player climbs 25 feet without incident.
- **Failure by 4 or Less:** The player slips but catches themselves. They make no progress but take no damage.
- **Failure by 5 or More:** The player falls. For every 10 feet fallen, the player takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage. (Maximum fall distance: 50 feet.)

Players with climbing gear (pitons, rope, etc.) have advantage on the check. Players proficient in Athletics can use the Help action to assist one another.

### Alternative Routes

- **Magical Solutions:** Spells like _spider climb_, _levitate_, or _fly_ bypass the climb entirely.
- **Scouting Ahead:** A player who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a slightly less steep route to the left, reducing the climb DC to 12.
- **Max's Help (Optional):** If the players have previously shown kindness to animals or succeeded on an Animal Handling check, Max appears at the top of the climb and barks encouragingly. This grants inspiration (DM's discretion) or advantage on one player's climb check.

## X3d. The Threshold

Once the players reach the ledge above the steep ascent, they encounter the Threshold—a ring of ancient standing stones marking the boundary of the Grinch's Mist-pocket demi-refuge. Read:

<div class="description"> <p>You haul yourselves onto a narrow ledge, gasping for breath. The wind dies abruptly here, replaced by an unnatural stillness. Before you stands a ring of ancient stones—seven in all, leaning at odd angles like drunken sentinels. They are carved with symbols you don't recognize, worn smooth by centuries of wind and rain.</p> <p>The Mists pool thickly within the ring, swirling in slow, deliberate patterns. The temperature drops sharply—colder than the ascent, colder than the Barovian winter. You feel it in your bones: you are crossing a threshold. Beyond this point, you leave the mortal world behind.</p> </div>

### Crossing the Threshold

When the players step through the ring of standing stones, read:

<div class="description"> <p>The moment you cross between the stones, the world... *shifts*. The Mists close in behind you like a curtain falling. Sound becomes muffled, as though you're hearing it through water. Your breath fogs in the air, but the fog lingers too long, drifting lazily instead of dissipating.</p> <p>Time feels wrong here. You're not sure if you've been walking for seconds or hours. The mountain ahead seems both closer and farther away, its peak a crooked silhouette against a sky that is somehow darker than the gray you left behind.</p> <p>This place does not want you. You feel it watching—not with eyes, but with something older and more patient. The mountain, the Mists, the very stones beneath your feet... all of it waits to see what you will do.</p> </div>

### Metaphysical Properties

The Mist-pocket operates like the Abbey of Saint Markovia (CoS, p. 151):

- **Magic Suppression:** Divination spells of 3rd level or lower automatically fail within the Mist-pocket.
- **Teleportation Block:** Teleportation into or out of the pocket fails unless the caster succeeds on a DC 18 spellcasting ability check.
- **Time Dilation:** Time flows strangely within the pocket. 1 hour inside equals approximately 30 minutes outside (or vice versa, at DM discretion). This effect is subtle but unsettling.
- **Emotional Resonance:** The Grinch's bitterness suffuses the area. All Charisma saves made within the Mist-pocket are made with disadvantage.

### Wisdom Save

Each player must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become disoriented for 1d4 hours. A disoriented character has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and cannot accurately judge the passage of time. (This does not prevent them from continuing; it simply heightens the unease.)

_**Effects of Failure.**_ If a player fails the save, describe how the mountain seems to shift around them—paths that were clear a moment ago now vanish, landmarks repeat themselves, and the crooked peak above seems to move when they're not looking directly at it.

# X4. The Workshop

<span class="citation"><em>This scene takes place in a new location: The Grinch's Workshop.</em></span>

Beyond the Threshold, the path winds upward for another hour before reaching the summit—or, more precisely, the mouth of a cave carved into the mountain's peak. This is the Grinch's Workshop, his lair, and the heart of his isolation.

## X4a. Exterior Approach

As the players near the summit, read:

<div class="description"> <p>The path ends at a dark opening in the mountainside—a natural cave mouth, half-hidden by an overhang of jagged rock. Over the years, someone has fortified the entrance with salvaged timber and rusted metal plates, crude but effective. Smoke seeps from cracks in the rock above, venting through a makeshift chimney.</p> <p>Warnings are scratched directly into the cave walls and painted on wooden planks nailed to the stone: "GO AWAY." "NO JOY ALLOWED." "TRESPASSERS WILL BE MISERABLE." Beneath one warning, someone has drawn a crude skull with crossed-out eyes.</p> <p>A heavy curtain of oiled canvas hangs across the entrance, keeping out the wind. From within, you hear the faint sounds of muttering—a low, bitter voice speaking to itself—and the occasional clatter of metal on stone.</p> </div>

### Exterior Features

_**Cave Mouth.**_ The entrance is roughly 8 feet wide and 6 feet tall, narrowing as it leads inward. The oiled canvas curtain can be pushed aside easily, but doing so is noisy (disadvantage on Stealth checks).

_**Makeshift Alarm.**_ Trip wires connected to clattering pots span the entrance at ankle height. A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher notices them automatically; otherwise, a DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check is required. Disarming the alarm requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. If triggered, the alarm alerts the Grinch (proceed to [[#A4d. Confronting the Grinch]]).

_**Max's Nook.**_ Just inside the cave mouth, in a sheltered alcove to the left, is Max's resting spot: a pile of old blankets, a chew toy (a knotted length of rope), and a water bowl. If Max is present, he regards the players warily but does not immediately attack.

_**Junk Piles.**_ Scattered near the entrance are broken toys, discarded gadgets, and salvaged materials—evidence of the Grinch's tinkering. A player who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check and spends 10 minutes searching finds 2d10 gp worth of salvageable parts (gears, springs, small tools).

_**The Lookout.**_ A rocky ledge above the cave entrance provides a clear view of Vallaki below. A battered telescope (functional) points at the town square. If the players climb to the Lookout (DC 10 Strength (Athletics)), they can see Vallaki's rooftops and, on a clear day, the spire of St. Andral's Church.

## X4b. Entering the Workshop

If the players enter the cave (quietly or not), read:

<div class="description"> <p>The cave opens into a low-ceilinged chamber, cluttered with stolen goods and the detritus of years of isolation. Toys—broken and whole—are piled in corners. Decorations dangle from hooks hammered into the stone walls. The natural rock is blackened by torch smoke, and the air smells of cold metal, damp stone, and something bitter you can't quite name.</p> <p>Shelves carved into the walls hold more stolen items: lanterns, bolts of fabric, small household goods. Everything is organized with obsessive care, as though the Grinch cannot bear disorder in his domain.</p> <p>To your right, a passage leads deeper into the mountain. To your left, you see the flicker of firelight—a workroom, perhaps, or a living space. Ahead, hanging from a central support beam, is a hand-lettered sign: "MINE. ALL MINE."</p> </div>

### Zone 1: Entry Cavern

This is the main chamber, approximately 30 feet across and 8 feet high (ceiling). The walls are natural stone, but the Grinch has modified the space over years: hooks and shelves hammered into the rock, support beams added where the ceiling sags, and a rough stone floor swept clean of debris.

_**Stolen Goods.**_ The chamber is filled with items taken from Vallaki: toys, decorations, food (dried meats, preserves), small luxuries (candles, soap, perfume). A player who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check recognizes some items as belonging to Blinsky (the toys) and others as typical Long Night decorations (garlands, painted stars, wicker suns).

_**Trap: Collapsing Shelf.**_ One of the shelves is rigged to collapse if certain items are touched (the Grinch uses this to deter intruders). If a player removes an item from the eastern shelf without first succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check to notice the trap, the shelf collapses. All creatures within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

_**Max's Presence.**_ If Max has not yet been encountered, he is here, sitting by the entrance to the workroom (Zone 2). He watches the players but does not attack unless they attempt to harm the Grinch or steal items from the cave.

## X4c. Exploring the Workshop

The Grinch's Workshop consists of four interconnected zones:

### Zone 2: The Workroom

A side chamber converted into the Grinch's gadget-crafting space. Workbenches built from salvaged wood line the walls; stalactites have been broken off to make room for hanging tools. A small forge built into a natural fissure vents smoke through cracks in the ceiling.

_**Tools and Supplies.**_ The workroom contains tinker's tools, blacksmith's tools, and approximately 50 gp worth of raw materials (scrap metal, leather, wire, gears). A player proficient in tinker's tools recognizes the quality of the setup—whoever works here is skilled.

_**Loot.**_ On a high shelf carved into the rock: a pair of [[Sleigh Boots]] (Wondrous item, uncommon; see document index 4). In a wooden crate: 1d4 [[Snap-Trap Net]]s (Weapon (net), uncommon, consumable; see document index 5). If the players search the forge, they find a half-finished gadget (the Grinch's current project): a mechanical music box that plays a discordant, mocking tune.

### Zone 3: The Vault

A narrow passage (5 feet wide, 7 feet high) leads to a smaller cave where the Grinch hoards his most prized stolen items. A heavy wooden door, fitted into the cave mouth, bars entry. The door is locked (DC 16 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to pick).

_**Contents.**_ Inside: Blinsky toys (including several dolls that resemble Ireena Kolyana, if the DM wishes to foreshadow Arc G), festival decorations (including the Baron's missing wicker sun pieces), children's gifts (wrapped packages, some unopened), and 150 gp in coin and valuables (jewelry, silverware).

_**Max's Shrine.**_ In a corner alcove, carefully arranged: bones (from past meals), a soft blanket, and a worn chew toy. This is the Grinch's "shrine" to Max—evidence that, despite his bitterness, he cares deeply for his companion.

### Zone 4: The Grinch's Chamber

The deepest chamber, warmed by a fireplace built into a natural chimney formation. The ceiling here is 10 feet high, and the space is surprisingly sparse:

- A bed of piled furs and blankets (enough for one creature).
- A single wooden chair, worn smooth by years of use.
- Shelves carved into the rock, holding books with cracked spines (titles include _On Isolation and Its Virtues_, _The Art of Mechanical Craft_, and _Reflections on a Life Wasted_).
- A small table with a single plate, a single cup, and a half-eaten meal (dried meat, stale bread).

_**Evidence of Loneliness.**_ The chamber is meticulously maintained but utterly devoid of joy. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals the tragedy: this is the home of someone who has forgotten how to live with others. The single plate, the single chair, the books on isolation—all of it screams loneliness.

_**The Grinch's Presence.**_ If the Grinch has not yet been encountered, he is here, sitting by the fire with Max at his feet. If the players have triggered alarms or made noise, he is waiting for them, sword in hand (see [[#A4d. Confronting the Grinch]]).

## X4d. Confronting the Grinch

The Grinch becomes aware of the players' presence in one of the following ways:

- They trigger the makeshift alarm at the entrance.
- They make excessive noise while exploring (multiple failed Stealth checks, combat with Max, etc.).
- They reach his chamber (Zone 4).
- Max alerts him (if the players have threatened or attacked Max).

When the Grinch confronts the players, read:

<div class="description"> <p>A low, bitter voice echoes from the shadows: "Well, well, well. More intruders. More thieves coming to steal from the thief. How... predictable."</p> <p>He steps into the firelight—a hunched figure, green-skinned and gaunt, with long, clawed fingers and eyes that gleam with resentment. He wears tattered clothing cobbled together from stolen fabrics, and his face is twisted in a permanent scowl.</p> <p>Beside him stands a dog—or something like a dog. Its eyes glow faintly amber, its movements too precise to be natural. It watches you without blinking.</p> <p>"You've come for the toys, I suppose," the Grinch sneers. "The precious little gifts. The symbols of your disgusting *joy*." He spits the word like a curse. "Well, you're not getting them. This is *mine*. All of it. My mountain, my cave, my *life*."</p> <p>He raises a clawed hand, and you see the glint of a crude blade at his belt. "Turn around. Leave. Or I'll make you regret climbing this mountain."</p> </div>

> [!profile]+ **Profile: The Grinch**
> 
> **Roleplaying Information** _**Resonance.**_ The Grinch should evoke pity beneath the menace—a creature warped by isolation and bitterness, yet not beyond redemption.
> 
> _**Emotions.**_ The Grinch most often feels bitter, lonely, suspicious, grudgingly curious, defensive, angry, and—rarely—wistful.
> 
> _**Motivations.**_ The Grinch wants to punish those who celebrate while he suffers in solitude, to protect Max (his only companion), and—deep down—to be part of something larger than himself (though he would never admit this).
> 
> _**Inspirations.**_ When playing the Grinch, channel the Jim Carrey portrayal (wounded beneath the menace), Frankenstein's Monster (misunderstood, shaped by cruelty), and Strahd himself (a dark mirror—isolation breeding monstrosity).
> 
> **Character Information** _**Persona.**_ To the world, the Grinch is a monster—a story to frighten children. To himself, he is the only one who sees the truth: that hope in Barovia is a cruel joke, and those who celebrate are either fools or liars. He has crafted an identity around his bitterness, using theatrical villainy as armor against a world that rejected him.
> 
> _**Morale.**_ In combat, the Grinch fights with savage cunning—using gadgets, traps, and his rage in tandem. He will flee if reduced below 30 HP _unless Max is threatened_, in which case he fights to the death. If Max is killed, he enters a grief-fueled frenzy (+2 to attack rolls, -2 to AC) until defeated or the combat ends.
> 
> _**Relationships.**_ The Grinch's only relationship is with Max, his mist-touched construct companion. He would die for Max without hesitation. This bond is the key to his redemption. He has no other allies, no other friends, no other connections to the world.

### Initial Reaction

The Grinch's initial reaction to the players depends on how they entered:

- **Stealthily (No Alarms):** The Grinch is surprised and defensive. He assumes the worst—that they are here to kill him or steal from him—but his first instinct is to threaten, not attack. He hopes they will leave without forcing a fight.
- **Loudly (Alarms Triggered):** The Grinch is prepared and hostile. He has had time to set traps, summon Max, and position himself advantageously. He assumes they are enemies and behaves accordingly.
- **After Harming Max:** The Grinch is enraged beyond reason. He attacks immediately, using his most dangerous abilities without hesitation. (See [[#Combat with the Grinch]].)

### Possible Player Approaches

The players have several options when confronting the Grinch:

1. **Violence:** Attack immediately. (Proceed to [[#Combat with the Grinch]].)
2. **Negotiation:** Attempt to reason with him. (Proceed to [[#Negotiating with the Grinch]].)
3. **Kindness to Max:** Show compassion to Max, thereby disarming the Grinch's hostility. (Proceed to [[#The Key to Redemption]].)
4. **Retreat:** Leave the mountain without engaging. (The Grinch does not pursue but remains a threat.)

> [!warning]+ **Max as Emotional Lever** 
> Max is the key to reaching the Grinch. The players' treatment of Max will determine whether the Grinch can be redeemed—or whether he becomes a vengeful enemy. Pay close attention to how the players interact with Max, and adjust the Grinch's reactions accordingly.

## X4e. Negotiating with the Grinch

If the players attempt to negotiate with the Grinch rather than immediately attacking, he is initially skeptical but willing to listen—if only to mock them. Read:

<div class="description"> <p>The Grinch's eyes narrow. "Negotiate? *Negotiate?*" He barks a laugh—bitter, hollow, self-mocking. "What could *you* possibly offer *me*? Companionship? Forgiveness? A place at your table on the Long Night?"</p> <p>He leans forward, claws gripping the back of his chair. "You want your toys back? Your precious little *symbols*? Fine. I'll give them to you. But answer me this: *why*? Why do you celebrate? Why do you string up your lights and sing your songs when the Mists swallow everything? When the Devil himself watches from his castle and laughs at your hope?"</p> <p>His voice drops to a whisper. "What's the *point*?"</p> </div>

### The Grinch's Questions

The Grinch genuinely wants to understand why the players care about the stolen items. He is not asking rhetorically—he is asking because he has forgotten the answer, and some part of him desperately wants to remember.

If the players engage with his questions sincerely, the conversation can unfold as follows:

_**Why do you celebrate?**_ The players can share their reasons for valuing joy, community, or hope. A successful DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check moves the Grinch to thoughtful silence; he has no immediate rebuttal.

_**What does hope accomplish?**_ The players can argue that hope sustains people even when the situation seems hopeless. A successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check causes the Grinch to glance at Max—a flicker of recognition crossing his face.

_**What gives life meaning?**_ The players can share their own motivations: friendship, duty, love, curiosity, revenge, etc. The Grinch has no counter-argument for genuine passion. If the players speak from the heart, no check is required—the Grinch simply listens.

### Possible Outcomes

_**Success (DC 14+ on Persuasion checks, or genuine roleplay).**_ The Grinch's hostility falters. He sits heavily in his chair, suddenly looking very old and very tired. "Maybe you're right," he mutters. "Maybe I've been up here too long. Maybe... maybe I forgot what it was like to be part of something."

He looks at Max. "What do you think, boy? Should I trust them?"

If Max reacts positively to the players (tail wag, friendly posture), the Grinch sighs and agrees to return the stolen goods—on the condition that the players promise not to tell anyone where they came from. "Let them think it was magic. Let them think it was luck. But don't... don't tell them about me." (Proceed to [[#The Key to Redemption]].)

_**Failure (DC 13 or lower, or insincere arguments).**_ The Grinch shakes his head bitterly. "You don't understand. You _can't_ understand. You're just like the rest of them—clinging to your delusions, pretending everything is fine."

He stands, gripping his weapon. "Get out. Now. Before I change my mind about letting you leave alive." (The players can still attempt to redeem him through kindness to Max, or they can fight. Proceed to [[#Combat with the Grinch]] or [[#The Key to Redemption]].)

## X4f. Combat with the Grinch

If the players attack the Grinch, or if negotiations fail and the players refuse to leave, combat begins. The Grinch fights with savage cunning, using the terrain and his gadgets to maximum advantage.

### Battlefield Setup

The battle takes place in the Grinch's chamber (Zone 4) unless the players ambush him elsewhere:

- **Terrain:** The chamber is 30 feet across with a 10-foot ceiling. The fireplace provides dim light; the rest of the room is shadowed.
- **Cover:** The bed, chair, and bookshelves provide half cover.
- **Hazards:** The fire deals 1d6 fire damage to any creature that enters it or starts its turn there.

### The Grinch's Tactics

_**Round 1:**_ The Grinch uses his _**Gadget: Smoke Bomb**_ to obscure the battlefield (15-foot-radius sphere of heavy obscurement), then uses his _**Nimble Escape**_ to Disengage and reposition.

_**Round 2:**_ The Grinch throws his _**Gadget: Snap-Trap Net**_ at the most dangerous-looking player (typically a heavily armored fighter or a spellcaster).

_**Round 3+:**_ The Grinch alternates between _**Multiattack**_ (Claw attacks) and using his _**Gadget: Spring-Loaded Claws**_ for a devastating strike. He focuses on one target at a time, attempting to bring them down quickly.

_**Desperation (Below 30 HP):**_ The Grinch uses his remaining gadgets recklessly and focuses entirely on the player who has dealt the most damage to him. He fights with feral intensity, snarling insults and accusations.

_**Fleeing (Below 15 HP, and Max is alive):**_ The Grinch attempts to flee using his _**Nimble Escape**_ and his knowledge of the cave system. He will not abandon Max; if Max is incapacitated or killed, the Grinch fights to the death.

### Max's Role

Max fights alongside the Grinch, using his _**Defensive Pounce**_ reaction to protect his master. If the Grinch is reduced to 0 HP, Max howls mournfully and ceases fighting, sitting by the Grinch's body. If Max is reduced to 0 HP first, the Grinch enters a grief-fueled frenzy (see "Morale" in his profile).

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Grinch can take one lair action while within his Workshop:

1. **Trigger Trap:** A hidden mechanism activates. One creature the Grinch can see must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained until the end of its next turn (a net drops from the ceiling).
2. **Douse the Lights:** All nonmagical light sources in the Workshop are extinguished (including the fireplace). The Grinch has darkvision; most intruders do not.
3. **Mist Surge:** The Mists within the Workshop thicken. Until initiative count 20 of the next round, the area is heavily obscured (beyond 5 feet), and creatures other than the Grinch and Max have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.
4. **Max, Attack!:** Max immediately moves up to his speed and makes a Bite attack against a creature of the Grinch's choice (uses Max's reaction).

> [!combat]- **Balancing the Grinch** 
> This combat encounter is a **deadly** encounter against a party of five 4th-level players and will consume approximately 90% of their total maximum hit points (assuming the Grinch uses lair actions and Max fights alongside him). For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:
> 
> - _**Three Players.**_ Reduce the Grinch's hit points to 100. Remove Max from the encounter or make him a non-combatant.
> - _**Four Players.**_ Reduce the Grinch's hit points to 118. Max fights alongside the Grinch but has 20 HP instead of 27.
> - _**Six Players.**_ Increase the Grinch's hit points to 154. Max has 40 HP instead of 27.

### Grinch Statblock

See document index 7 for the Grinch's full statblock.

### Max Statblock

See document index 3 for Max's full statblock.

### Aftermath of Combat

_**If the Grinch is Slain:**_ Max howls for three days, then vanishes into the Mists—never seen again. The Mist-pocket begins to collapse over 7 days; the cave system becomes unstable (rocks fall, passages collapse). After 7 days, Mt. Crumpit is no longer accessible—the Mists swallow it entirely. Vallakian children tell darker stories; the legend grows more fearsome.

_**If the Grinch is Subdued (Reduced to 0 HP but Stabilized):**_ The Grinch wakes 1d4 hours later, bitter and broken. If Max is alive, Max's presence prevents the Grinch from attempting escape or revenge. If the players show him mercy, he can still be redeemed (proceed to [[#The Key to Redemption]]).

_**If the Players Flee:**_ The Grinch does not pursue but remains a threat. He will raid Vallaki again on the Long Night.

## X4g. The Key to Redemption

The fastest path to redeeming the Grinch is through Max. If the players show genuine kindness to Max—offering him food, petting him, speaking gently to him, using _speak with animals_ to communicate—Max responds with overwhelming gratitude. This, in turn, breaks through the Grinch's defenses.

### Earning Max's Trust

Max is starved for affection. Any sincere act of kindness—no matter how small—earns his trust:

- Offering food (even stale rations): Max's tail wags.
- Petting him or scratching behind his ears: Max leans into the touch, eyes half-closed.
- Using _speak with animals_ to tell him he's a good dog: Max responds, "Really? I am? I try so hard to be good."
- Healing him if he's injured: Max licks the player's hand, whimpering gratefully.

A player who spends at least 1 minute showing kindness to Max automatically earns his trust. No check is required—Max's loyalty is unconditional.

### The Grinch's Reaction

When the Grinch sees the players treating Max with kindness, his hostility crumbles. Read:

<div class="description"> <p>The Grinch's clawed hand falters, his weapon lowering. He stares at you—at the way you speak to Max, the way you touch him, the way Max responds with such simple, unguarded joy—and something in his expression breaks.</p> <p>"You... you're not here to hurt him?" The Grinch's voice is hoarse, almost disbelieving. "You're not here to take him away?"</p> <p>He sinks into his chair, suddenly looking less like a monster and more like an old man who has forgotten how to be anything else. "No one has ever..." He trails off, unable to finish the sentence.</p> <p>Max trots over to the Grinch and sits at his feet, tail wagging. The Grinch places a clawed hand on Max's head, and for a moment, you see something raw and vulnerable in his eyes.</p> <p>"Why?" he asks quietly. "Why do you care about a dog? About... about *me*?"</p> </div>

### The Turning Point

This is the moment where the players can redeem the Grinch. They can respond in several ways:

_**"Everyone deserves kindness."**_ The Grinch blinks, as though the concept is foreign. "Even thieves? Even monsters?" If the players affirm this, he nods slowly. "Maybe... maybe you're right."

_**"Max loves you. That says something."**_ The Grinch looks at Max, his expression softening. "He's the only thing that's kept me... human. If he loves me, maybe I'm not as far gone as I thought."

_**"You don't have to be alone."**_ The Grinch flinches as though struck. "Alone? I _chose_ this. I... I..." He trails off, unable to finish the lie. "Maybe I didn't choose it. Maybe I just... forgot there was another option."

_**"You can still change."**_ The Grinch laughs bitterly, but there's no real malice in it. "Change? At my age? After all I've done?" He looks at Max again. "But... maybe. For him, if not for me."

### The Grinch's Offer

If the players' words are sincere, the Grinch makes the following offer:

<div class="description"> <p>The Grinch rises slowly, his shoulders slumped. "I'll return the toys," he says quietly. "All of it. The decorations, the gifts... everything. I'll take it back to Vallaki myself. On the Long Night."</p> <p>He pauses, then adds, almost shyly: "And... maybe I'll stay. Just for a little while. Just to see what it's like. To be... part of something."</p> <p>Max barks happily, tail wagging so hard his whole body shakes.</p> </div>

_**Milestone.**_ Redeeming the Grinch completes a story milestone. Award each player 1,000 XP.

# X5. The Long Night

Whether the players redeem the Grinch, defeat him, or never confront him at all, the Long Night eventually arrives. This section describes how the event unfolds based on the players' choices.

## X5a. The Long Night: Unredeemed Grinch

If the players have not redeemed the Grinch and he is still alive, he descends from Mt. Crumpit on the Long Night to raid Vallaki. This occurs between midnight and dawn, when most Vallakians have retired to their homes.

### The Raid

The Grinch and Max move silently through the streets, entering homes through chimneys, windows, or unlocked doors. They take:

- Decorations (garlands, painted stars, wicker suns)
- Gifts (wrapped packages, toys)
- Food (bread, preserves, holiday meals)
- Candles (symbolic of hope)

The Grinch does not harm people—he is a thief, not a killer—but his presence is terrifying. Children wake to see a green-skinned figure looming over them; adults find their homes violated, their carefully prepared celebrations stolen.

### Player Intervention

If the players are in Vallaki during the Long Night, they have several options:

_**Guard the Town Square.**_ If the players station themselves in the town square (N8. Town Square, p. 119), they can catch the Grinch mid-raid. Roll initiative when they spot him. (See [[#Combat with the Grinch]] for his tactics.)

_**Guard Blinsky's Shop.**_ If the players guard Blinsky Toys (N7. Blinsky Toys, p. 118), the Grinch attempts to break in again. The players can ambush him or negotiate (see [[#Negotiating with the Grinch]]).

_**Patrol the Streets.**_ If the players patrol Vallaki, they can encounter the Grinch with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. He flees if spotted, leading them on a chase through the streets.

_**Set a Trap.**_ If the players have deduced the Grinch's pattern (targeting symbols of joy on the Long Night), they can set a trap. The Grinch walks into it unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

### Aftermath

_**If the Raid Succeeds:**_ Vallaki wakes to devastation. Children cry; adults despair; the Baron rages. The town's morale plummets. The Grinch returns to Mt. Crumpit, surrounded by stolen goods, feeling hollow.

_**If the Raid is Prevented:**_ The Grinch retreats to Mt. Crumpit, nursing wounded pride. Vallaki celebrates, but uneasily—the threat remains. The players are hailed as heroes (if their role was public) or quietly thanked (if they acted in secret).

## X5b. The Long Night: Redeemed Grinch

If the players have redeemed the Grinch, he descends from Mt. Crumpit on the Long Night—not to steal, but to return what he has taken. This is the arc's emotional climax.

### The Return

Read the following as the Long Night festivities begin:

<div class="description"> <p>The Long Night has come to Vallaki. Candles flicker in windows; the town square is lit by torches and a great bonfire. Baron Vallakovich leads the crowd in forced carols, but here and there, you see glimpses of genuine joy: a mother's hand on her daughter's shoulder, two old friends sharing a flask, a young man placing a gift beneath a decorated tree.</p> <p>Then, from the edge of the square, a murmur rises. Heads turn. Conversations falter. The Baron's voice trails off.</p> <p>A figure emerges from the Mist—tall, hunched, green-skinned. Beside him trots a dog with glowing amber eyes. The figure carries an enormous sack over one shoulder, bulging with... something.</p> <p>Children gasp. Adults reach for weapons. The Baron raises a hand, his face pale.</p> <p>The figure stops at the edge of the light. For a moment, no one moves. Then, slowly, the figure kneels and sets down the sack. It opens.</p> <p>Toys spill out. Decorations. Gifts. All the things that have been stolen over the years, returned in a single gesture.</p> <p>The Grinch looks up, his face unreadable. "I... I thought you might want these back," he says, his voice rough. "I'm... sorry. For everything."</p> <p>Max barks happily and wags his tail. A child giggles. And slowly, hesitantly, Vallaki begins to smile.</p> </div>

### Vallaki's Reaction

The reaction depends on the players' involvement and the town's mood:

_**If the Players Vouched for the Grinch:**_ The townspeople are wary but willing to give him a chance. They accept the returned goods cautiously, murmuring thanks. A few brave souls approach to thank him directly.

_**If the Players Did Not Vouch for Him:**_ The townspeople are suspicious and fearful. Guards move to surround the Grinch, but Baron Vallakovich (reluctantly) orders them to stand down—after all, the goods have been returned. The atmosphere is tense.

_**If the Players Helped Redeem Him Publicly:**_ The townspeople recognize the players' role. They thank the players first, then cautiously approach the Grinch. Someone offers him a cup of mulled wine. He accepts, awkwardly.

### The Grinch's Integration

If the Grinch is genuinely welcomed, he stays for the festivities—awkward, out of place, but trying. Max is an instant hit with the children, who pet him and throw sticks for him. The Grinch watches, and for the first time in years, he smiles.

_**New Tradition:**_ A Vallakian elder suggests leaving a gift "for the mountain" each Long Night—a gesture of thanks. The Grinch is deeply moved and promises to protect Vallaki in his own way.

_**Long-Term Impact:**_ The Grinch becomes a reluctant guardian of Vallaki. He does not join the town permanently (Mt. Crumpit is still his home), but he checks on them regularly. He crafts gadgets for the town guard, repairs broken tools, and intervenes if monsters threaten the area.

_**Milestone.**_ Completing the Long Night with a redeemed Grinch completes a story milestone. Award each player an additional 500 XP (total 1,500 XP for the arc).

## X5c. The Long Night: Grinch Slain

If the Grinch was killed, the Long Night proceeds without his interference. However, the absence of his raids is not entirely a relief—the townspeople sense something has changed, though they don't know what.

### Atmosphere

The Long Night feels... hollow. The decorations are safe, the gifts intact, but the sense of defiance—the feeling that Vallaki is asserting its existence against the darkness—is diminished. Some Vallakians mourn the loss of the Green Man, recognizing too late that his raids were part of what made the Long Night meaningful.

Children tell darker stories. The counting song gains a new verse:

<div class="description" style="text-align: center;"> <p>Eleven, twelve, they sent him to hell,</p> <p>Thirteen, fourteen, the mountain is mourning,</p> <p>Fifteen, sixteen, a ghost in between.</p> </div>

### Mt. Crumpit

If the players return to Mt. Crumpit after killing the Grinch, they find it collapsing. The Mist-pocket is unraveling:

<div class="description"> <p>The mountain groans. Stone cracks; passages collapse. The Mists swirl violently, as though in mourning. At the summit, the cave mouth yawns open like a wound.</p> <p>Inside, the Workshop is empty. The stolen goods are gone—reclaimed by the Mists, or perhaps never real to begin with. Only Max's blanket remains, neatly folded in his alcove.</p> <p>The wind howls, and you swear you hear it: a distant, bitter laugh, fading into silence.</p> </div>

After 7 days, Mt. Crumpit is inaccessible. The Mists swallow it entirely.

# Design Notes: The Long Night & the Grinch of Mt. Crumpit

_**Thematic Purpose.**_ This arc explores the themes of isolation, bitterness, and redemption. The Grinch is a mirror to Strahd—both are creatures shaped by loneliness and resentment—but unlike Strahd, the Grinch can still be saved. The arc asks: _Can kindness reach someone who has forgotten how to be kind?_

_**Max as Emotional Lever.**_ Max is the key to the Grinch's redemption. His unconditional loyalty and simple joy cut through the Grinch's cynicism. Players who treat Max with compassion will find the Grinch far easier to redeem. Conversely, harming Max is the fastest way to make the Grinch an implacable enemy.

_**The Grinch's Motivation.**_ The Grinch raids Vallaki not out of malice but out of desperation. He cannot bear the sight of others' joy because it reminds him of what he has lost. Stealing their happiness gives him a fleeting sense of control—but it never fills the void inside him.

_**The Long Night.**_ The Long Night is Barovia's midwinter observance—a fragile assertion of hope in the darkness. It is not a joyful celebration but a quiet act of defiance. The Grinch's raids are an attack on that defiance, making him a symbolic antagonist: he represents despair, isolation, and the temptation to give up.

_**Redemption vs. Violence.**_ The arc is designed to reward players who seek non-violent solutions. Killing the Grinch is the "easy" option, but it leaves Vallaki diminished and the mountain lost. Redeeming him requires empathy, patience, and kindness—but the rewards are far greater.

_**Integration with Core Campaign.**_ This arc is modular and can be inserted at any point after the players reach Vallaki. It does not interfere with other plotlines (St. Andral's Feast, the Feast of St. Andral, the Baron's festivals, etc.) but complements them thematically. The Grinch can become a recurring ally if redeemed, or a cautionary tale if slain.

_**Strahd's Indifference.**_ Strahd is aware of the Grinch but considers him beneath notice. The Grinch poses no threat to Strahd's plans, and his bitterness is a kind of art Strahd can appreciate. Strahd will not intervene in this arc unless the players do something to draw his attention.

_**The Mist-Pocket.**_ Mt. Crumpit exists in a localized Mist-pocket, similar to the Abbey of Saint Markovia. This explains why the Grinch has not aged normally, why time feels strange on the mountain, and why the location collapses if the Grinch dies. The Mists preserve him—and his bitterness—as a kind of monument to isolation.
