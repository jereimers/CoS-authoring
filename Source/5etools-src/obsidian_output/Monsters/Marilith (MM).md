## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The marilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The marilith's weapon attacks are magical.

**Reactive.** The marilith can take one reaction on every turn in combat.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The marilith can make seven attacks: six with its longswords and one with its tail.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], the marilith can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the marilith can't make tail attacks against other targets.

**Teleport.** The marilith magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.



## Reactions

**Parry.** The marilith adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the marilith must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
