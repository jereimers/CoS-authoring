# Tempus

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Tempus is a war god concerned with brave conduct, using force to settle disputes, and encouraging bloodshed. The Foehammer is friendly with Gond for his war machines and was once Beshaba's lover. Tempus sponsored the Red Knight's ascension to divinity.

This god of war is random in his favors, meaning his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Tempus might be an army's ally one day and its enemy the next. When he manifests before a battle, he can appear to either side in the conflict. If he rides Veiros, his white mare, the army will succeed. If he rides Deiros, his black stallion, defeat is certain. Most often, he rides with one foot in each mount's stirrup, signifying the unpredictable nature of battle.

In such visions, Tempus is a powerfully built warrior dressed for battle in the style of those who see him. When he speaks to mortals directly, his voice reverberates in a clash of weapons, or he sends a Celestial [[Berserker|XMM]] to carry his will.

Over the centuries, Tempus's priests have spread and enforced a common code that encourages rules of war, respect for reputation, and professional behavior on the battlefield. This code, called Tempus's Honor, encourages conflicts to be brief, decisive, and as safe as possible for bystanders. The rules in the code include the following: arm anyone who has need of a weapon, disparage no foe, acquit yourself with bravery, train all for battle, and don't engage in feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields, kill noncombatants, or engage in torture in the name of war are considered enemies.

Worshipers of Tempus are a legion, and soldiers carry his name in their hearts. His priests are tacticians skilled in the art of war. Many of his priests serve as battlefield chaplains with armies and mercenary companies, encouraging fellow soldiers with word and blade. Priests of Tempus teach that war conducted properly is fair because it impacts all sides equally, with each soldier poised for both death and glory. Mortals shouldn't fear war but should see it as a natural force—the storm that civilization brings about by its existence.

The Chosen of Tempus are masterful tacticians, fearsome warriors, and powerful leaders. They find their way to battlefields with such certainty that many suspect the Chosen's presence causes battles to break out.

## Stormknives

Mercenaries loyal to Tempus have long identified themselves through the symbol of a rusty dagger dripping four drops of blood. In recent years, these mercenaries have organized around a common code of conduct beyond Tempus's Honor. These individuals call themselves Stormknives.

A warrior who wishes to become a Stormknife simply declares themself to be one. They carry a dagger at all times—even while sleeping or bathing—and wear a patch bearing four drops of blood. When these individuals sign a mercenary contract, or any other binding agreement related to war or conflict, they add four red marks to their signature, signifying the commitments of a Stormknife.

Each of the four drops of blood in the Stormknives' symbol represents a commitment, ranked in ascending order of importance. The first of these represents loyalty to the sword and signifies the Stormknife's obligation to seek out battle at every opportunity. Whenever a Stormknife is given a choice between violent and nonviolent methods to solve a problem, they should choose violence.

The second drop represents loyalty to the client. A Stormknife respects the wishes of the individual they're working for, obeying them whenever possible. A client, for example, might order a Stormknife to put away their weapons and retreat from battle, and the Stormknife is obliged to obey.

The third drop represents loyalty to the contract, emphasizing the letter of the contract over the client's wishes. If, for example, a client instructs a Stormknife not to loot a body, but the contract includes such plunder as the Stormknife's right, the mercenary can disobey the client in favor of the contract.

And finally, the fourth drop represents loyalty to Tempus. The wishes and whims of the Lord of Battles supersede other rules, even a written contract. But it's up to individual Stormknives to determine what Tempus's will might be, leading to corruption and abuse. Some Stormknives use this part of their code as an excuse to break a contract or disobey a client's wishes, claiming such deeds are the will of Tempus and thus unavoidable.
