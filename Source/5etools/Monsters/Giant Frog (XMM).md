## Traits

**Amphibious.** The frog can breathe air and water.

**Standing Leap.** The frog's [[Long Jump|XPHB]] is up to 20 feet and its [[High Jump|XPHB]] is up to 10 feet with or without a running start.


## Actions

**Bite.** m +3, reach 5 ft. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) Piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 11).

**Swallow.** The frog swallows a Small or smaller target it is grappling. While swallowed, the target isn't [[Grappled|XPHB]] but has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions, and it has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the frog. While swallowing the target, the frog can't use Bite, and if the frog dies, the swallowed target is no longer [[Restrained|XPHB]] and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.

At the end of the frog's next turn, the swallowed target takes 5 (**2d4**) Acid damage. If that damage doesn't kill it, the frog disgorges it, causing it to exit [[Prone|XPHB]].
