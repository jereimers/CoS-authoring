## Traits

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the wight has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wight attacks twice with Grave Bolt.

**Grave Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) necrotic damage.

**Life Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a [[zombie]] under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve [[zombie|]] under its control at one time.
