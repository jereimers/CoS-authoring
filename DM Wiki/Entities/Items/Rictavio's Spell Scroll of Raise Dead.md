# Rictavio's Spell Scroll of Raise Dead

## Description
[[Rudolph van Richten]] carries a **spell scroll of raise dead** among his equipment. This scroll contains the 5th-level necromancy spell *raise dead*, which can return a dead creature to life. As a practical monster hunter who has lost many allies over the years, Van Richten understands the value of having resurrection magic available.

## Properties
- **Type:** Spell Scroll (5th level)
- **Spell:** *Raise Dead*
- **Rarity:** Rare
- **Attunement:** No

## Spell: Raise Dead
*5th-level necromancy*

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

## Usage
Rictavio (as a 9th-level cleric spellcaster) can cast this spell directly from the scroll.

## Notes
- A valuable emergency resource that could save a party member's life
- Van Richten can already prepare this spell as a 9th-level cleric, but the scroll provides an additional casting
- Demonstrates Van Richten's preparedness and experience as a monster hunter
- Could be a significant treasure if obtained by the party
