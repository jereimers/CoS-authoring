# Gnome

**Size:** Small  
**Speed:** 30  

## Darkvision

You have [[Darkvision|XPHB]] with a range of 60 feet.

## Gnomish Cunning

You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

## Gnomish Lineage

You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose one of the following options; whichever one you choose, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage):

- **Forest Gnome:** You know the [[Minor Illusion|XPHB]] cantrip. You also always have the [[Speak with Animals|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also use any spell slots you have to cast the spell.
- **Rock Gnome:** You know the [[Mending|XPHB]] and [[Prestidigitation|XPHB]] cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting [[Prestidigitation|XPHB]] to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from [[Prestidigitation|XPHB]]; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action.
