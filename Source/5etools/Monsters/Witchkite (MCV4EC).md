## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the witchkite fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The witchkite makes two Rend attacks and uses Malevolent Flare once.

**Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Malevolent Flare.** The witchkite spits magical, green-tinged flame at one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (**5d8**) fire damage and suffers one of the following effects of the witchkite's choice:

- The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of the witchkite's choice that is within the target's reach.
- The target takes 13 (**2d12**) psychic damage.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.



## Reactions

**Enchanting Gaze.** When a creature the witchkite can see moves within 10 feet of it, the witchkite emits an enchanting gaze at the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage and have the [[charmed]] condition until the end of its next turn.

**Retribution.** Immediately after taking damage from a melee attack, the witchkite makes one Rend attack against the attacker.
