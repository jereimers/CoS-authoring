## Traits

**Vigilant.** The defender can't be [[surprised]].


## Actions

**Force-Empowered Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack @hitYourSpellAttack to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. @h**1d8 + PB** force damage.

**Repair (3/Day).** The magical mechanisms inside the defender restore `2d8 + PB` hit points to itself or to one construct or object within 5 feet of it.



## Reactions

**Deflect Attack.** The defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see that is within 5 feet of it, provided the attack roll is against a creature other than the defender.
