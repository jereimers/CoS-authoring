## Traits

**Earth Glide.** The seer can traverse through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the seer doesn't disturb the material it moves through.

**Magic Resistance.** The seer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The seer uses Fission Staff twice, Psychedelic Orb twice, or each one once.

**Fission Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h9 (**1d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (**4d8**) radiant damage, and the target is knocked [[prone]].

**Psychedelic Orb.** The seer hurls a glimmering orb at one creature it can see within 120 of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take 27 (**5d10**) psychic damage and suffer a random condition until the start of the seer's next turn. Roll a `d6` for the condition: (1-2) [[blinded]], (3-4) [[frightened]], or (5-6) [[stunned]].



## Reactions

**Fuse Damage.** When the seer is hit by an attack, it takes only half of the triggering damage. The first time the seer hits with a melee attack on its next turn, the target takes an extra **1d6** radiant damage.
