## Traits

**Amphibious.** The grung can breathe air and water.

**Poisonous Skin.** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A [[poisoned]] creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Standing Leap.** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

**Water Dependency.** If the grung isn't immersed in water for at least 1 hour during a day, it suffers 1 level of [[exhaustion]] at the end of that day. The grung can recover from this [[exhaustion]] only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 5 (**2d4**) poison damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 5 (**2d4**) poison damage.

**Mesmerizing Chirr {@recharge}.** The grung makes a chirring noise to which grungs are immune. Each Humanoid or Beast that is within 15 feet of the grung and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of the grung's next turn.
