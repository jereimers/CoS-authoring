# Hiddukel

**Pantheon:** Dragonlance  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil  
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** Broken merchant's scales

Hiddukel is the god of greed and treachery. He holds domain over all ill-gotten wealth in the world, and criminals and unscrupulous traders worship him in secret. While Hiddukel gladly accepts their worship, his true goal is the acquisition not of riches, but of souls.
