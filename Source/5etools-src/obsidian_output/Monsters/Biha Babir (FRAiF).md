## Traits

**Amphibious.** Biha Babir can breathe air and water.

**Elemental Restoration.** If Biha Babir dies outside the Elemental Plane of Water, her body dissolves into brine, and she gains a new body in `1d4` days, reviving with all her [[Hit Points|XPHB]] somewhere on the Plane of Water.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Biha Babir fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Wishes.** Biha Babir knows the [[Wish|XPHB]] spell but can cast it only on behalf of a non-genie creature who communicates a wish in a way Biha Babir can understand. If Biha Babir casts the spell for a creature, she suffers none of the spell's stress. Once Biha Babir has cast it three times, she can't do so again for 365 days.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Biha Babir makes two Marine Burst attacks. She can replace one of these attacks with a Tail attack.

**Marine Burst.** m,r +10, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) Cold damage.

**Tail (Marid Form Only).** m +10, reach 15 ft. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) Bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.


## Bonus Actions

**Fluid Form.** Biha Babir shape-shifts into a form resembling a Beast or Humanoid that is Medium or smaller, while retaining her game statistics (other than her size), or returns to her true marid form.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Misty Burst.** Biha Babir teleports to an unoccupied space she can see within 30 feet of herself and makes one Marine Burst attack.

**Whirlpool.** str DC 18, each creature in a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from Biha Babir. @actSaveFail 10 (**3d6**) Force damage, and the target is pulled 15 feet straight toward Biha Babir. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only. @actSaveSuccessOrFail Biha Babir can't use this action again until the start of her next turn.
