# Eilistraee

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

In realms such as the Underdark where worship of Lolth is prevalent, drow and other folk who oppose the Spider Queen turn to Eilistraee as a beacon of hope and freedom. She is the drow god of dance, song, beauty, moonlight, swordplay, and hunting.

Eilistraee was born to the gods Lolth and Corellon Larethian. Melancholy yet defiant, she resents the iron grip her mother has over drow cities such as [[Menzoberranzan|FRHoF]]. In response, Eilistraee encourages her followers to pursue their own destinies, which might mean fleeing the Underdark and living on the surface. She communicates with her worshipers through dance-like dreams awash in gentle moonlight. In recent years, Eilistraee's message of freedom and harmony has begun to echo beyond drow society. Folk in regions plagued by conflict or oppression might enter Eilistraee's worship after being inspired by a story of a hopeful future that Eilistraee can provide.

Followers of Eilistraee show their gratitude to the god by dancing beneath every full moon. Her priests are passionate advocates of the arts, especially song and dance. Temples to Eilistraee are some of the few places willing to teach the elven technique of bladesinging, and travelers visit from afar to learn this ancient skill. Her priests practice a variant known as sword dancing, which blends bladesinging with bardic arts from the College of Dance. Eilistraee's temples in the Underdark are refuges from the region's subterranean perils, concealed with powerful magic and requiring a sword-shaped key to enter.

Eilistraee inspires two main adventuring orders: the Silverhair Knights and the Darksong Knights. The Silverhair Knights demonstrates the strength that lies in mercy and compassion. The order engages in combat only when absolutely necessary, even then strictly adhering to nonlethal techniques. The Darksong Knights is a smaller order, dedicated to hunting and destroying yochlols and Lolth's other demonic agents.

Eilistraee's Chosen are diplomats, traversing the surface and the Underdark alike. They put their lives on the line to broker mutual understanding in even the most unlikely places.
