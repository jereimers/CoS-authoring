## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the stone defender remains motionless against an uneven earthen or stone surface, it is indistinguishable from that surface.

**Magic Resistance.** The stone defender has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it is knocked [[prone]].



## Reactions

**Intercept Attack.** In response to another creature within 5 feet of it being hit by an attack roll, the stone defender gives that creature a +5 bonus to its AC against that attack, potentially causing a miss. To use this ability, the stone defender must be able to see the creature and the attacker.
