## Traits

**Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ghast must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the ghast's Stench for 24 hours.

**Turn Defiance.** The ghast and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
