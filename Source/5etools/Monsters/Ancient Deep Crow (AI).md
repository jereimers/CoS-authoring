## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The ancient deep crow has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the ancient deep crow can take the Hide action as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The ancient deep crow makes three attacks: one with its mandibles and two with its claws.

**Mandibles.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the ancient deep crow can't use its mandibles on another target.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Shadow Caw.** The ancient deep crow releases an ear-splitting caw. Each creature within 60 feet of the crow and able to hear it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Detect.** The deep crow makes a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check.

**Shadow Caw (Costs 2 Actions).** The ancient deep crow uses Shadow Caw.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The ancient deep crow beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the deep crow must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (**2d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[prone]]. The ancient deep crow can then fly up to half its flying speed.
