## Traits

**Life Hunger.** If a creature within 60 feet of the sorrowsworn regains hit points, the sorrowsworn gains two benefits until the end of its next turn: it has advantage on attack rolls, and its Bite deals an extra 22 (**4d10**) necrotic damage on a hit.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sorrowsworn makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**4d6 + 4**) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16), and it is [[restrained]] until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, the sorrowsworn can't make a Claw attack.
