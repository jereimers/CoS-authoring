# Charm of the Sun

*Charm*

You learn the [[Light]] cantrip if you don't already know it. You can cast [[Sunburst]], requiring no spell components and using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Once used, the charm vanishes from you, and you unlearn the [[Light]] cantrip gained from this charm.
