# Find Traps

*2nd-level divination*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the [[Alarm|XPHB]] or [[Glyph of Warding|XPHB]] spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
