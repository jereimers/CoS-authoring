## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the paeliryon's darkvision.

**Keen Eyes.** The paeliryon scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

**Magic Resistance.** The paeliryon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The paeliryon makes three Claw attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with Draining Grasp (if available).

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) slashing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) fire damage.

**Draining Grasp {@recharge 4}.** The paeliryon makes a Claw attack. On a hit, the target's Charisma score is reduced by 2 (`1d4`). This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. A creature whose Charisma is reduced to 3 or less because of this ability, has the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute.
