# Who they are

The Grinch is a reclusive, bitter creature who dwells atop [[Mt Crumpit]], a mist-shrouded peak near [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. Green-skinned and hunched, he is spoken of in whispers by Vallakian children as a boogeyman who steals joy from those foolish enough to celebrate. In truth, he is a tragic figure—once perhaps human—twisted by the Mists and decades of isolation into something both more and less than what he was.

# What the party knows

The party may have heard rumors of the "Green Devil" from Vallakian children or nervous guards. Some say he steals toys; others claim he eats hope itself. The truth is harder to discern.

# Personality

The Grinch is deeply bitter, viewing all celebration as a personal affront. He oscillates between theatrical villainy and genuine anguish. His cruelty stems from loneliness, not malice—though he would never admit it. He is fiercely protective of [[Max]], his only companion, and this bond represents the last ember of warmth in his frozen heart.

# The Grinch Profile

## Portrait
*No portrait available.*

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
The Grinch should inspire a complex emotional response: initial fear or disgust giving way to pity, and ultimately the possibility of compassion. Players should sense that beneath the theatrical villainy lies genuine pain.

### Emotions
- **Default State:** Bitter, sardonic, theatrical in his cruelty
- **When Challenged:** Rageful, unpredictable, surprisingly cunning
- **When Shown Kindness:** Confused, suspicious, then slowly vulnerable
- **Around Max:** Gentle, protective, almost tender

### Motivations
- **Primary:** Punish Vallaki for celebrating while he suffers alone
- **Secondary:** Protect Max at all costs
- **Hidden:** Desperately wants connection but fears rejection

### Inspirations
- The Grinch (Jim Carrey portrayal—wounded beneath the menace)
- Frankenstein's Monster (misunderstood, shaped by cruelty)
- Strahd himself (a dark mirror—isolation breeding monstrosity)

### Vocal Notes
- Low, gravelly baseline with sudden mocking falsetto shifts
- Mutters constantly to Max or himself
- When angry, voice drops to dangerous whisper before exploding
- Laughs are hollow, bitter, self-mocking

### Signature Lines
- "Joy? In *Barovia*? How deliciously naive."
- "They sing and they feast while the Mists swallow everything. Someone should teach them the truth."
- "Max is the only honest soul in this wretched land. The rest of you? *Performers.*"
- (When offered kindness) "What's your angle? Everyone has an angle."

## Character Information

### Persona
To [[Vallakians]], the Grinch is a monster—a story to frighten children. To himself, he is the only one who sees the truth: that hope in Barovia is a cruel joke, and those who celebrate are either fools or liars. He has crafted an identity around his bitterness, using theatrical villainy as armor against a world that rejected him.

### Morale
In combat, the Grinch fights with savage cunning—using gadgets, traps, and his rage in tandem. He will flee if reduced below 30 HP *unless Max is threatened*, in which case he fights to the death. If Max is killed, he enters a grief-fueled frenzy (+2 to attack rolls, -2 to AC) until defeated or the combat ends.

### Relationships
- **[[Max]]:** His only companion. The Grinch would die for Max without hesitation. This bond is the key to his redemption.
- **[[Gadof Blinsky]]:** The Grinch despises Blinsky's cheerful toymaking—a painful reminder of joy he cannot share. He has stolen from Blinsky's shop.
- **[[Vallaki]]:** Views the town with contempt. Their festivals disgust him.
- **[[Strahd von Zarovich]]:** Aware of Strahd but considers him irrelevant. "Another monster. At least I'm honest about what I am."

### Knowledge
- Knows the layout of Mt. Crumpit intimately
- Has observed Vallaki's patterns for years
- Understands the Mist-pocket nature of his home (though not its metaphysics)
- Knows nothing of the larger plots in Barovia—he has isolated himself too long

>

>

>
> ### Reactions
> ***Bitter Retaliation.*** When the Grinch takes damage from a creature within 5 feet of him, he can make one Claw attack against that creature.

## Combat Tactics
1. **Opening:** Uses Smoke Bomb to obscure the battlefield, then Rages
2. **Mid-Combat:** Prioritizes fragile-looking spellcasters; uses Snap-Trap Net on the most dangerous melee threat
3. **Desperate:** Uses Spring-Loaded Claws for a devastating strike, then attempts to flee with Max
4. **If Max is Threatened:** Abandons all tactics, focuses entirely on protecting Max

## Redemption Conditions
The Grinch can be redeemed if the party:
1. Shows genuine kindness to Max (not manipulation—he can tell the difference)
2. Includes him in a celebration without mockery
3. Helps him understand that his isolation was a choice, not a sentence

**Mechanical Trigger:** If the party succeeds on three separate DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) checks during non-combat interactions *and* demonstrates kindness to Max, the Grinch's alignment shifts to Chaotic Good and he becomes an ally.

## If Slain
- Max howls for three days, then vanishes into the Mists—never seen again
- The Mist-pocket begins to collapse; Mt. Crumpit becomes inaccessible within a week
- Vallakian children tell darker stories; the legend grows

## If Redeemed
- The Grinch descends from Mt. Crumpit on [[The Long Night]], returning stolen goods
- He may become a reluctant ally, offering gadgets to the party
- Max serves as an emotional anchor, keeping him stable
- The Mist-pocket stabilizes; Mt. Crumpit becomes a potential safe haven

# Notes
- The Grinch is designed as a tragic figure, not a pure villain
- His redemption should feel earned, not forced
- Max is the key—kindness to Max opens the door
