## Origin Stories

How you came to live among colossal creatures is up to you to determine, but the Foundling Origin table suggests a variety of possibilities.

**Foundling Origin**

| d6 | Origin |
|---|---|
| 1 | You were found as a baby by a family of nomadic giants who raised you as one of their own. |
| 2 | A family of stone giants rescued you when you fell into a mountain chasm, and you have lived with them underground ever since. |
| 3 | You were lost or abandoned as a child in a jungle that teemed with ravenous dinosaurs. There, you found an equally lost frost giant; together, you survived. |
| 4 | Your farm was crushed and your family killed in a battle between warring groups of giants. Racked with guilt over the destruction, a sympathetic giant soldier promised to care for you. |
| 5 | After you had a series of strange dreams as a child, your superstitious parents sent you to study with a powerful but aloof storm giant oracle. |
| 6 | While playing hide-and-seek with your friends, you stumbled into the castle of a cloud giant, who immediately adopted you. |

## Building a Giant Foundling Character

Your life among giants has given you a unique perspective. Though you are unusually large for your kind, you're no larger than a giant child, so you might be very mindful of your size.

## Feature: Strike of the Giants

You gain the [[Strike of the Giants|BGG]] feat.

## Suggested Characteristics

The Giant Foundling Personality Traits table suggests a variety of traits you might adopt for your character.

| d6 | Personality Trait |
|---|---|
| 1 | What I lack in stature compared to giants, I make up for with sheer spite. |
| 2 | I insist on being taken seriously as a full-grown adult. Nobody talks down to me! |
| 3 | Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I'd much rather be in an open field than a bustling tavern. |
| 4 | I embrace my shorter stature. It helps me stay unnoticed—and underestimated. |
| 5 | Every avalanche begins as a single pebble. |
| 6 | The world always feels too big, and I'm afraid I'll never find my place in it. |
