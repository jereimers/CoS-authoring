## Traits

**Baleful Presence.** Sources of light in a 60-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the spawn flicker wildly. Nonmagical sources of [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in that area instead shed [[Dim Light|XPHB]].

**Regeneration.** The spawn regains 5 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].

**Running Leap.** With a 10-foot running start, the spawn can [[Long Jump|XPHB]] up to 30 feet.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spawn makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** m +5, reach 10 ft. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) Slashing damage.

**Bite.** m +5, reach 5 ft. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) Piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 13). While [[Grappled|XPHB]], the target has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition.
