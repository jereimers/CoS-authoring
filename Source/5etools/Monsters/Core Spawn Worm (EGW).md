## Traits

**Illumination.** The worm sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius.

**Radiant Mirror.** If the worm takes radiant damage, each creature within 20 feet of it takes that damage as well.

**Tunneler.** The worm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The worm makes two attacks: one with its barbed tentacles and one with its bite.

**Barbed Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h25 (**5d6 + 8**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]]. The tentacles can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h30 (**5d8 + 8**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 21 (**6d6**) fire damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
