# Blue Mist Fever

A magical mist creeps through the jungles of Chult. Contact with this thin, blue, odorless mist can infect giants and humanoids with blue mist fever. A [[dispel magic]] spell destroys the mist in a 20-foot square starting at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range. An encounter with this mist typically covers `1d6` such areas (400-2,400 square feet).

A giant or humanoid that comes into contact with the mist must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with blue mist fever. An infected creature begins seeing vivid hallucinations of blue monkeys `1d6` hours after failing the save, and the hallucinations last until the disease ends on the creature. A creature can repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, ending the effect on itself on a success.
