## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two Thundering Stone Club or Boulder attacks in any combination.

**Thundering Stone Club.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. The giant can cause the club to emit a burst of thunderous energy that deals 10 (**3d6**) thunder damage to each creature, other than the giant, within 30 feet of the target. The club can emit a burst this way only once per turn.

**Boulder.** Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition. After the giant throws the boulder, roll a `d6`; on a roll of 3 or lower, the giant has no more boulders to throw.



## Reactions

**Unyielding.** In response to failing a saving throw to avoid being moved, having the [[prone]] condition, or both, the giant succeeds instead.
