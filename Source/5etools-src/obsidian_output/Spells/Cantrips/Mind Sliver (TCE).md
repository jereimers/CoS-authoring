You drive a disorienting spike of psychic energy into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take **1d6** psychic damage and subtract `1d4` from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by **1d6** when you reach certain levels: 5th level (**2d6**), 11th level (**3d6**), and 17th level (**4d6**).
