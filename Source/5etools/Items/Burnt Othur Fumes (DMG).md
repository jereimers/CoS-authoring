# Burnt Othur Fumes

*Item, None*

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (**1d6**) poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.
