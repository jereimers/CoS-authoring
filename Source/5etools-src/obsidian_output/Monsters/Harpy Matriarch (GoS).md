## Traits

**Luring Maestro.** While within 60 feet of the matriarch, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the matriarch's Luring Song.

**Magic Resistance.** The matriarch has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The matriarch makes two claws attacks.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Fleeting Form.** The matriarch can magically disguise itself to resemble a humanoid of roughly similar size and shape for up to 1 hour. It can revert to its true form as a bonus action. This illusion does not hold up to close scrutiny.

**Luring Song.** The matriarch sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the matriarch that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [[charmed]] until the song ends. The matriarch must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the matriarch is [[incapacitated]].

While [[charmed]] by the matriarch, a target is [[incapacitated]] and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the [[charmed]] target is more than 5 feet away from the matriarch, the target must move on its turn toward the matriarch by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the matriarch, the target can repeat the saving throw. A [[charmed]] target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this matriarch's song for the next 24 hours.

**Visage of Desire (1/Day).** The matriarch projects a vision into the minds of creatures within 30 feet of it that aren't constructs or undead, showing each creature achieving whatever it most desires. An affected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become [[paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn.
