# Q33. Collapsed Ceiling

The roof over this part of the mansion has collapsed, creating a twenty-foot-diameter gaping hole with broken rafters bisecting it. Dark storm clouds roll across the sky overhead. The floor is piled with rocks, broken tiles, shattered beams, and other debris. Beneath the rubble lie a sagging floor and puddles of rainwater.

The ceiling here is 20 feet high, and the rubble is difficult terrain.
Vladimir Horngaard (see area Q36) can hear visitors climbing over the rubble and can't be surprised by them.
