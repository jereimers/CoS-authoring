## Traits

**Overheat.** When the maschin-i-bozorg is reduced to 0 hit points, its power source overloads, briefly superheating its outer shell. Each creature within 10 feet of the maschin-i-bozorg must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (**2d6**) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The maschin-i-bozorg makes two Poison Jab attacks.

**Poison Jab.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h13 (**4d4 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Steam Jet {@recharge 5}.** The maschin-i-bozorg emits scalding steam in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (**8d6**) fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Bonus Actions

**Crushing Stride.** The maschin-i-bozorg moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this movement, it can enter Medium and smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the maschin-i-bozorg enters must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space out of the maschin-i-bozorg's path. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (**3d6**) bludgeoning damage and has the [[prone]] condition.

If the maschin-i-bozorg remains in the [[prone]] creature's space, the creature also has the [[restrained]] condition until it's no longer in the same space as the maschin-i-bozorg. While [[restrained]] in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength ([[Athletics]]) check. On a successful check, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the maschin-i-bozorg.
