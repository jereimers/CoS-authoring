## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the hart fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hart makes a Lightning Antlers attack and a Thunder Hooves attack.

**Lightning Antlers.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the start of the hart's next turn.

**Thunder Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) thunder damage.



## Reactions

**Entangling Growth.** Immediately after a creature the hart can see within 120 feet of itself hits it with an attack roll, the hart reduces the damage to itself by half. The attacker must immediately make a DC 16 Strength saving throw as beanstalks coil around it in its space. On a failed save, the creature has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16) and has the [[restrained]] condition as long as it is [[grappled]]. The beanstalks vanish after 1 minute, if the hart has the [[incapacitated]] condition, or when the hart dies.

**Lightning Call.** In response to making a saving throw, the hart calls down a bolt of lightning that targets a creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 19 (**3d12**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
