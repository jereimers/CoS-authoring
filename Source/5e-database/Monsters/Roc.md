## Special Abilities

**Keen Sight.** The roc has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The roc makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

**Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d8 + 9) piercing damage.

**Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the roc can't use its talons on another target.
