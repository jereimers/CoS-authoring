**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance.** The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The devil makes three melee attacks: one with its tail and two with its claws. Alternatively, it can use Hurl Flame twice.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Hurl Flame.** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d6**) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
