## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wormling makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 5**) piercing damage. If the target is a Small or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the wormling, and it takes 3 (**1d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the wormling's turns.

If the wormling takes 10 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the wormling must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the wormling. If the wormling dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 5 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Tail Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
