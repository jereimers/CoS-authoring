## Traits

**Weird Aura.** At the start of each of the gargantua's turns, each creature of the gargantua's choice within 30 feet of it must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target sees the gargantua as a manifestation of the target's worst fears; it takes 17 (**5d6**) psychic damage and has the [[frightened]] condition until the start of the target's next turn. On a successful save, a target is immune to this gargantua's Weird Aura for 24 hours.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The gargantua makes two Slam or Rock attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h27 (**3d12 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +15 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. @h24 (**3d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Baleful Hex.** The gargantua curses one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn.

**Teleport.** The gargantua teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space that it can see within 120 feet of itself.


## Reactions

**Flick.** Immediately after the gargantua takes damage from a Large or smaller creature it can see within 20 feet of itself, it attempts to flick the creature away. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw, or the target takes 18 (**3d6 + 8**) bludgeoning damage, is pushed horizontally up to 100 feet away from the gargantua, and has the [[prone]] condition.

**Spell Mimicry (1/Day).** Immediately after a creature the gargantua can see casts a spell of 5th level or lower, the gargantua tries to copy the spell. That creature must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw, or the gargantua immediately casts the same spell at the same level (+11 to hit with spell attacks, spell save DC 19), requiring no material components and choosing the spell's targets.
