**Multiattack.** The myrmidon makes three Trident attacks.

**Trident.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) force damage, or 8 (**1d8 + 4**) force damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Freezing Strikes {@recharge}.** The myrmidon uses Multiattack. Each attack that hits deals an extra 5 (**1d10**) cold damage. A target that is hit by one or more of these attacks has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of the myrmidon's next turn.
