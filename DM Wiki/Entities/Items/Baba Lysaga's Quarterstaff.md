# Baba Lysaga's Quarterstaff

A gnarled **quarterstaff** wielded by [[Baba Lysaga]], the ancient witch who claims to be [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich]]'s true mother. Despite her advanced age and hunched appearance, Baba Lysaga wields this staff with surprising strength and ferocity, capable of making three attacks per round.

## Notes
- Despite being a powerful spellcaster, Baba Lysaga is also formidable in melee combat
- Her +4 Strength modifier reflects her unnatural vitality granted by Mother Night
- The staff may be mundane, but Baba Lysaga's ferocity makes it dangerous
- She typically prefers her devastating spells but will use the staff if forced into melee
