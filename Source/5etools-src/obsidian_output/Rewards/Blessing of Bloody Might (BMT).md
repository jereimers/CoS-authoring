*Blessing*

Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

## Consequence

The character is cursed with werewolf [[Player Characters as Lycanthropes|MM]] (see the [[Monster Manual|MM]]) until the blessing ends on them. On nights when the moon is full, the cursed character flies into a rage that lasts until dawn; while in this state, the character becomes an NPC under the DM's control.
