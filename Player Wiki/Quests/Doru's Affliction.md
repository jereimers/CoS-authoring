# Objective
Help [[Father Donavich]] rid [[Doru]] of his vampiric affliction.

# What the Party knows
- Three months ago, [[Doru]] led an ill-fated rebellion against [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. None returned save Doru, who stumbled home weeks later as a [[Vampire Spawn]]. 
- His father, the priest [[Father Donavich|Donavich]], mentioned that Doru had fallen in with a traveling wizard–whom he blamed for enabling Doru’s foolhardy insurgency–but that the wizard hadn’t been seen since Doru’s rebellion either.
- Doru is trying to resist his condition's compulsion to drink blood. He starves himself and insists on being kept locked in the undercroft of his father's [[Church]].
