## Traits

**Mental Burst.** When the goblin dies, its pent-up mental energy explodes in a psychic blast. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or take 10 (**4d4**) psychic damage.

**Mental Fortitude.** The goblin has advantage on saving throws against effects that would make it have the [[charmed]] or [[frightened]] conditions.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The goblin makes three Psychic Blade attacks.

**Psychic Blade.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one creature. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) psychic damage, and the target must subtract `1d4` from the next attack roll or saving throw it makes before the end of the goblin's next turn.

**Synaptic Rend {@recharge 5}.** The goblin unleashes a 30-foot-radius sphere of psychic energy, centered on a point the goblin can see within 60 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (**4d6**) psychic damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of the goblin's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.


## Bonus Actions

**Nimble Escape.** The goblin takes the Disengage or Hide action.


## Reactions

**Psionic Shield.** When the goblin or one of its allies within 15 feet of it is hit by an attack roll, the goblin conjures a shield of force. The target of the attack gains a +3 bonus to its AC against the triggering attack roll, potentially causing it to miss.
