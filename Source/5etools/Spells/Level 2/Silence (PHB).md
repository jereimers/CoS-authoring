# Silence

*2nd-level illusion (ritual)*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are [[deafened]] while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
