# Charm of the Talons

*Charm*

As an action, you can cast [[Dispel Magic]], requiring no spell components and using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). If you successfully end any spells with it, you gain `1d6` [[temporary hit points|PHB]] for each spell level of the highest-level spell ended. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
