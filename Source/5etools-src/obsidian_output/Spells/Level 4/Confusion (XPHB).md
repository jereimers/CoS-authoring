# Confusion

*4th-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (three nut shells)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature in a 10-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target can't take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll `1d10` at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn, consulting the table below.

| 1d10 | Behavior for the Turn |
|---|---|
| 1 | The target doesn't take an action, and it uses all its movement to move. Roll `1d4` for the direction: **1**, north; **2**, east; **3**, south; or **4**, west. |
| 2-6 | The target doesn't move or take actions. |
| 7-8 | The target doesn't move, and it takes the [[Attack|XPHB]] action to make one melee attack against a random creature within reach. If none are within reach, the target takes no action. |
| 9-10 | The target chooses its behavior. |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]'s radius increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 4.
