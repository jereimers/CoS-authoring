## Traits

**Evasion.** If Karas is subjected to an effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Karas instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the save and only half damage if she fails. She can't use this trait if she has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day or 4/Day in Lair).** If Karas fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Tyrant's Blade.** m +8, reach 5 ft. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) Slashing damage, and the target has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the start of Karas's next turn. If the target is already [[Frightened|XPHB]], it instead takes 10 (**3d6**) Psychic damage.
