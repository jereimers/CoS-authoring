# Synaptic Static

*5th-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You cause psychic energy to erupt at a point within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on that point makes an Intelligence saving throw, taking **8d6** Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

On a failed save, a target also has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it subtracts `1d6` from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as any Constitution saving throws to maintain [[Concentration]]. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
