## Close Encounter

You had a harrowing encounter with one of Wildspace's many terrors. You escaped with your life, but the encounter left you with a scar or two, or perhaps a recurring nightmare. Roll on the Close Encounter table to determine which creature nearly got the best of you. Creatures marked with an asterisk appear in [[Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM]]; the others are described in the [[Monster Manual|MM]].

## Feature: Wildspace Adaptation

You gain the [[Tough|]] from the [[Player's Handbook|PHB]]. In addition, you learned how to adapt to zero gravity. Being weightless doesn't give you disadvantage on any of your melee attack rolls (see "[[Weightlessness|AAG]]" in [[chapter 2|AAG]]).
