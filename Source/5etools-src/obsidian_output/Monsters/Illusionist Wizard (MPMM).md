## Actions

**Multiattack.** The illusionist makes two Arcane Burst attacks.

**Arcane Burst.** Attack (ms,rs) +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) psychic damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Displacement {@recharge 5}.** The illusionist projects an illusion that makes the illusionist appear to be standing in a place a few inches from its actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against the illusionist. The effect lasts for 1 minute, and it ends early if the illusionist takes damage, if it is [[incapacitated]], or if its speed becomes 0.
