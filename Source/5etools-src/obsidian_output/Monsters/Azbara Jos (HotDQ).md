## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Azbara has two [[spell scroll (1st level)|]] of [[mage armor]].

**Potent Cantrips.** When Azbara casts an evocation Cantrips and misses, or the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target still takes half the cantrip's damage but suffers no other effect.

**Sculpt Spells.** When Azbara casts an evocation spell that affects other creatures that he can see, he can choose a number of them equal to 1+the spell's level to succeed on their saving throws against the spell. Those creatures take no damage if they would normally take half damage from the spell.


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or ranged 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage.
