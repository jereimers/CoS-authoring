# Charm Person

*1st-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

---

One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [[Advantage|XPHB]] if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The [[Charmed|XPHB]] creature is [[Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB]] to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [[Charmed|XPHB]] by you.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
