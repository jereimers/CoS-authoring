## Traits

**Potion Mishap.** When Nauk uses the Imbibe Potion action more than once in an hour, roll `1d4` for what happens:

- 1. The potion works normally.
- 2. The potion works normally. In addition, Nauk turns [[invisible]] for 1 minute or until Nauk attacks or casts a spell.
- 3. The potion has no effect.
- 4. Instead of the normal effect, the potion causes fire to explode out of Nauk's mouth in a 15 foot cone. Nauk and any creature in the cone take 21 (**6d6**) fire damage.

**Relentless.** When Nauk is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead. He can't use this feature again for 24 hours

**Special Items.** Nauk wears [[adamantine plate armor]]. He wields a [[+1 maul]] and a [[+1 heavy crossbow]] which is already factored into his stats. He has 2 [[potion of cold resistance|]], 2 [[potion of fire resistance|]], 2 [[potion of lightning resistance|]]. He has 2 [[potion of heroism|]] and 4 [[potion of superior healing|]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Nauk makes three Magic Maul attacks. Nauk may substitute one of those attacks for the Imbibe Potion action.

**Magic Maul.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, ranged 100/400 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Imbibe Potion.** Nauk drinks a potion from the following list:

- Potion of heroism: Nauk gains 10 temporary hit points for 1 hour. For the same duration, Nauk is under the effect of the [[bless]] spell (no [[concentration]] required).
- Potion of resistance: Nauk gains resistance from one damage type for 1 hour. Nauk chooses from one of these damage types: cold, fire, lightning.
- Potion of superior healing: Nauk regains 28 hit points.



## Reactions

**Parry.** Nauk adds 4 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, Nauk must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
