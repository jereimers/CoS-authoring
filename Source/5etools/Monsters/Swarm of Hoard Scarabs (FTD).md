## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the swarm is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the swarm move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the swarm is animate.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny scarab. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Swarm of Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) piercing damage, or 6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage if the swarm is at half of its hit points or fewer, and the target has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Scale Dust (1/Day).** The swarm releases magical glittering dust from its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the swarm must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in blue light for 10 minutes. While outlined in this way, a creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from being [[invisible]]. In addition, every Dragon within 1 mile of the creature becomes aware of it and can unerringly track the creature. Casting [[dispel magic]] on the creature ends the effect on it.
