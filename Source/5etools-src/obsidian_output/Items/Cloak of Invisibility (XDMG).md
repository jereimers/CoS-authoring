# Cloak of Invisibility

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

This cloak has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the cloak, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to pull its hood over your head and expend 1 charge to give yourself the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition for 1 hour. The effect ends early if you pull the hood down (no action required) or cease wearing the hood.
