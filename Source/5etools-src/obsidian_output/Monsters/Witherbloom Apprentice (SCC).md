## Traits

**Regeneration.** The apprentice regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

**Verdant Talisman.** At the end of a 10-minute ritual, the apprentice can touch one willing creature (including itself) and bestow upon it a small talisman imbued with magic. Upon receiving the talisman, the creature gains 10 temporary hit points, and it can add `1d6` to its initiative rolls while it wears the talisman. These benefits last for 1 hour or until the apprentice conducts another ritual to bestow another talisman. When the benefits expire, the talisman crumbles to dust.


## Actions

**Briar Vine.** Melee Spell Attack +4 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) poison damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, the apprentice can pull it up to 10 feet closer to itself.



## Reactions

**Wither Burst.** When the apprentice sees a creature within 30 feet of itself drop to 0 hit points, the apprentice channels the expended life essence and targets another creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target takes 3 (**1d6**) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
