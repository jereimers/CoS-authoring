# Potion of Animal Friendship

*Item, Uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you can cast the level 3 version of the [[Animal Friendship|XPHB]] spell (save DC 13).

Agitating this potion's muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird feather, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
