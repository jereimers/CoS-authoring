## Actions

**Multiattack.** The b'rohg makes four Fist attacks or two Rock attacks.

**Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h23 (**4d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Hideous Rend.** The b'rohg uses all four of its hands to target one Large or smaller creature it can see within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the b'rohg can't make Fist attacks or Rock attacks, and the target takes 49 (**8d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is ripped into four pieces.
