# Heart Weaver's Primer

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a wizard)*

This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[antipathy/sympathy]], [[charm person]], [[dominate person]], [[enthrall]], [[hypnotic pattern]], [[modify memory]], and [[suggestion]]. It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.
- When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.
