# Ice Knife

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **1d10** Piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take **2d6** Cold damage.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The Cold damage increases by `2d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
