## Traits

**Stone Camouflage.** The giant has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.

**Olach Morrah.** The giant meditates for 1 hour, during which time it can do nothing else. At the end of the hour, provided the giant's meditation has been uninterrupted, it becomes [[petrified]] for 8 hours. At the end of this time, the giant is no longer [[petrified]] and gains tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet, as well as a measure of innate spellcasting ability for the next 24 hours.


## Actions

**Fling.** The giant tries to throw a Small or Medium creature within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 60 feet horizontally in a direction of the giant's choice. and land [[prone]], taking **1d6** bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.

**Rolling Rock.** The giant sends a rock tumbling along the ground in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**3d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage and falling [[prone]] on a failed save

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two adamantine greatclub attacks.

**Greatclub.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].



## Reactions

**Rock Catching.** If a rock or similar object is hurled at the giant, the giant can, with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, catch the missile and take no bludgeoning damage from it.
