## Traits

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

**Unusual Nature.** The dragon doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) cold damage.

**Cold Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a blast of frost in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (**3d8**) cold damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced.


## Bonus Actions

**Phase (2/Day).** The dragon becomes partially incorporeal for as long as it maintains [[concentration]] on the effect (as if [[concentration]] on a spell). While partially incorporeal, the dragon has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
