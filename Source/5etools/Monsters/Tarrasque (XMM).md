## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (6/Day).** If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The tarrasque has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Reflective Carapace.** If the tarrasque is targeted by a [[Magic Missile|XPHB]] spell or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll `1d6`. On a 1-5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected and reflects the spell, turning the caster into the target.

**Siege Monster.** The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The tarrasque makes one Bite attack and three other attacks, using Claw or Tail in any combination.

**Bite.** m +19, reach 15 ft. @h36 (**4d12 + 10**) Piercing damage, and the target has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 20). Until the grapple ends, the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and can't teleport.

**Claw.** m +19, reach 15 ft. @h28 (**4d8 + 10**) Slashing damage.

**Tail.** m +19, reach 30 ft. @h23 (**3d8 + 10**) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.

**Thunderous Bellow {@recharge 5}.** con DC 27, each creature and each object that isn't being worn or carried in a 150-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. @actSaveFail 78 (**12d12**) Thunder damage, and the target has the [[Deafened|XPHB]] and [[Frightened|XPHB]] conditions until the end of its next turn. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.


## Bonus Actions

**Swallow.** str DC 27, one Large or smaller creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by the tarrasque (it can have up to six creatures swallowed at a time). @actSaveFail The target is swallowed, and the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition ends. A swallowed creature has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions and can't teleport, it has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (**16d6**) Acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.

If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. If the tarrasque dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and can escape from the corpse using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[Prone|XPHB]].



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Onslaught.** The tarrasque moves up to half its [[Speed|XPHB]], and it makes one Claw or Tail attack.

**World-Shaking Movement.** The tarrasque moves up to its [[Speed|XPHB]]. At the end of this movement, the tarrasque creates an instantaneous shock wave in a 60-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from itself. Creatures in that area lose [[Concentration]] and, if Medium or smaller, have the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. The tarrasque can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.
