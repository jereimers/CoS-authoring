## Traits

**Amorphous.** The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.

**Corrosive Form.** A creature that hits the pudding with a melee attack roll takes 4 (**1d8**) Acid damage. Nonmagical ammunition is destroyed immediately after hitting the pudding and dealing any damage. Any nonmagical weapon takes a cumulative -1 penalty to attack rolls immediately after dealing damage to the pudding and coming into contact with it. The weapon is destroyed if the penalty reaches -5. The penalty can be removed by casting the [[Mending|XPHB]] spell on the weapon.

In 1 minute, the pudding can eat through 2 feet of nonmagical wood or metal.

**Spider Climb.** The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Dissolving Pseudopod.** m +5, reach 10 ft. @h17 (**4d6 + 3**) Acid damage. Nonmagical armor worn by the target takes a -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. The penalty can be removed by casting the [[Mending|XPHB]] spell on the armor.



## Reactions

**Split.** @actTrigger While the pudding is Large or Medium and has 10+ [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it becomes [[Bloodied]] or is subjected to Lightning or Slashing damage. @actResponse The pudding splits into two new Black Puddings. Each new pudding is one size smaller than the original pudding and acts on its [[Initiative|XPHB]]. The original pudding's [[Hit Points|XPHB]] are divided evenly between the new puddings (round down).
