## Traits

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny limb. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

**Unusual Nature.** The swarm doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The swarm makes one Undead Mass attack and one Grasping Limbs attack.

**Undead Mass.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, or 4 (**1d4 + 2**) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

**Grasping Limbs.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. @h7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage, and the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be [[restrained]]. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save. The creature is freed if it succeeds on this saving throw, the swarm moves out of the creature's space, or the swarm dies.
