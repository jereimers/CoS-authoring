# Robe of Eyes

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

- **All-Around Vision:** The robe gives you [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]]) checks that rely on sight.
- **Special Senses:** You have [[Darkvision|XPHB]] and [[Truesight|XPHB]], both with a range of 120 feet.

## Drawbacks

A [[Light|XPHB]] spell cast on the robe or a [[Daylight|XPHB]] spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for Light or DC 15 for Daylight), ending the condition on yourself on a success.
