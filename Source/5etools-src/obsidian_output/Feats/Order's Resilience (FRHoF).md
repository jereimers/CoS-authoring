# Order's Resilience

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Resurge

When you have the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition, you can right yourself with only 5 feet of movement.

## Stronger Together

If you are within 5 feet of an ally that doesn't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition, you and that ally have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Strength saving throws. You can't use this benefit while you have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.
