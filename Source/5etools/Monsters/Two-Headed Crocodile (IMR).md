## Traits

**Hold Breath.** The two-headed crocodile can hold its breath for 15 minutes.

**Two Heads.** The two-headed crocodile has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks and on saving throws against being [[blinded]], [[charmed]], [[deafened]], [[frightened]], [[stunned]], and knocked [[unconscious]].

**Wakeful.** When one of the crocodile's heads is asleep, its other head is awake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The two-headed crocodile makes two attacks with its bite.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and that head of the crocodile can't bite another target.
