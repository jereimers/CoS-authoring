## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The anathema has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Ophidiophobia Aura.** Any creature of the anathema's choice, other than a snake or a yuan-ti, that starts its turn within 30 feet of the anathema and can see or hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of snakes and yuan-ti. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours.

**Shapechanger.** The anathema can use its action to polymorph into a Huge giant constrictor snake, or back into its true form. its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.

**Six Heads.** The anathema has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks and on saving throws against being [[blinded]]. [[charmed]], [[deafened]], [[frightened]], [[stunned]], or knocked [[unconscious]].
