## Traits

**Crumbling Destruction.** When the colossus drops to 0 hit points, it crumbles and is destroyed. Any creature on the ground within 30 feet of the crumbling statue must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) bludgeoning damage and 22 (**4d10**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Fire Absorption.** Whenever the colossus is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the fire damage dealt.

**Immutable Form.** The colossus is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Weapons.** The colossus's weapon attacks are magical.

**Siege Monster.** The colossus deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The colossus of Akros makes two melee attacks.

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., or range 200/600 ft., one target. @h23 (**4d6 + 9**) piercing damage, or 27 (**4d8 + 9**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack. If the colossus makes a ranged attack with this spear, the spear magically returns to its hand after the attack.

**Sword.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h36 (**6d8 + 9**) slashing damage.

**Flames of Akros {@recharge}.** Magical flames issue from the colossus toward up to three creatures the colossus can see within 90 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (**8d8**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a target also magically catches fire for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the burning target repeats the saving throw. It takes 18 (**4d8**) fire damage on a failed save, and the effect ends on a successful one.
