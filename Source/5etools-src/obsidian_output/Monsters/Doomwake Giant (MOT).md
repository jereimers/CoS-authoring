## Traits

**Aura of Erebos.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the giant must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, or it takes 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage and can't regain hit points until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the giant's Aura of Erebos for 24 hours.

**Magic Resistance.** The giant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage.

**Noxious Gust {@recharge 5}.** The giant exhales a mighty gust that creates a blast of deadly mist in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 36 (**8d8**) necrotic damage and is knocked [[prone]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].
