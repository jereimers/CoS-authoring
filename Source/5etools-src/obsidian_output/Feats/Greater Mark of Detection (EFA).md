# Greater Mark of Detection

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Improved Intuition

When you use the Deductive Intuition benefit of your [[Mark of Detection|EFA]] feat, you can roll `1d6` instead of `1d4`.

## Shared Detection

When you use the Magical Detection benefit of your [[Mark of Detection|EFA]] feat to cast [[See Invisibility|XPHB]] without a spell slot, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. That creature also gains the benefits of the spell for its duration.
