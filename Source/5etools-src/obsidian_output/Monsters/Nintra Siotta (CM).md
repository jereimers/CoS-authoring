## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Nintra fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Nintra makes two attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d4 + 7**) piercing damage.

**Shard of Shadow.** Ranged Spell Attack +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d6 + 7**) necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.

**Storm of Shattered Glass {@recharge}.** Nintra targets a point she can see within 60 feet of her and creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of swirling glass shards centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (**8d6**) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. If Nintra is in the sphere, the shards deal no damage to her.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** Nintra makes one attack.

**Fey Step.** Nintra teleports to an unoccupied space she can see within 30 feet of her.

**Shadow Strikes (Costs 2 Actions).** Provided she is in bright or dim light, Nintra causes her shadow to attack a creature within 10 feet of her. Her shadow makes two claw attacks, each attack identical to Nintra's claw attack except that it deals psychic damage instead of piercing damage.
