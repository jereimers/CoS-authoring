# Charm of Cozmioko's Glory

*Charm*

This charm infuses you with the righteous vengeance of the brass dragon Cozmioko. You can use it as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action and choose one of the following effects:

- **Cozmioko's Fire:** You cast the [[Wall of Fire|XPHB]] spell (level 7 version, spell save DC 20), requiring no spell components.
- **Cozmioko's Light:** You regain 28 (`8d6`) Hit Points.
- **Cozmioko's Revenge:** One Melee weapon you are holding is infused with supernatural might for 1 minute or until you aren't holding the weapon. Once per turn, when you hit a Dragon with this weapon, the Dragon takes an extra `3d6` damage of the weapon's type.

Once you use the charm, it vanishes from you.
