# Necklace of Fireballs

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This necklace has `1d6 + 3` beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level [[fireball]] spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the [[fireball]] by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
