## Traits

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny snake. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. @h7 (**2d6**) piercing damage, or 3 (**1d6**) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (**4d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
