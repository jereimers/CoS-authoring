## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The slug has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Spider Climb.** The slug can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The slug makes two attacks: one with its tentacles and one with its bite.

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is [[paralyzed]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the poison on itself on a success.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**2d4 + 2**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Animate Tentacle.** When the slug takes damage in this cave ([[Shrine of Umberlee|ttp]]), it can use its reaction to animate one of the tentacles of the kraken statue and cause it to   make a melee weapon attack (+3 to hit) against one creature within 20 feet of the statue that the slug can see. The tentacle deals 8 (**1d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage on a hit.
