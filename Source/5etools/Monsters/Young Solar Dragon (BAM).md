## Traits

**Flyby.** The dragon doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Unusual Nature.** The dragon doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and one Tail attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) radiant damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Photonic Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a flashing mote of radiant energy that travels to a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of itself, then blossoms into a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (**8d10**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
