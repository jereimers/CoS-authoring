A beam of enervating energy shoots from you toward a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the target has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on Strength-based [[D20 Test|XPHB]] for the duration. During that time, it also subtracts `1d8` from all its damage rolls. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.
