## Traits

**Chameleon Carapace.** The thri-kreen can change the color of its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings. As a result, it has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide.

**Standing Leap.** The thri-kreen's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The thri-kreen makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way. The [[poisoned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**2d4 + 1**) slashing damage.
