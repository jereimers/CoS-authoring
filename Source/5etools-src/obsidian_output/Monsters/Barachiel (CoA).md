## Actions

**Multiattack.** Barachiel makes three Greatsword attacks.

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage plus 22 (**5d8**) radiant damage.

**Purifying Flames {@recharge 4}.** Barachiel wreathes his sword in white flame, then makes a Greatsword attack. On a hit, the target takes an additional 45 (**7d12**) fire damage plus 45 (**7d12**) radiant damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the end of their next turn.



## Reactions

**Parry.** Barachiel adds 5 to his AC against one attack. To do so, Barachiel must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
