## Actions

**Multiattack.** The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged attacks with its daggers.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
