## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** Anagwendol has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Anagwendol makes two attacks using her Defending Greatsword, Longbow, or a combination of the two.

**Defending Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h19 (**4d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 22 (**5d8**) radiant damage.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage damage plus 22 (**5d8**) radiant damage.

**Healing Touch (2/Day).** Anagwendol touches another creature. The target magically regains 30 (`6d8 + 3`) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.


## Bonus Actions

**Defensive Sword-work.** Anagwendol can forgo attacking with her Defending Greatsword on this turn and gain a +3 to her armor class. She can still attack with her Longbow.
