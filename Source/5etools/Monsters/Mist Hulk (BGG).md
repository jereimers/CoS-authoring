## Traits

**Air Form.** The mist hulk can enter another creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.

**Death Burst.** When the mist hulk dies, it bursts in a wave of water. Each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11 (**2d10**) bludgeoning damage and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The mist hulk makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) cold damage.

**Hideous Wailing {@recharge 5}.** The mist hulk releases a wail infused with magical anguish. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. A creature in the mist hulk's space has disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (**4d6**) psychic damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition for 1 minute. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
