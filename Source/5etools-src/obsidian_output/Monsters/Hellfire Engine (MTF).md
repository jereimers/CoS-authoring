## Traits

**Immutable Form.** The hellfire engine is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The hellfire engine has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Flesh-Crushing Stride.** The hellfire engine moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. A creature whose space the hellfire engine enters must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to the nearest space out of the hellfire engine's path. On a failed save, the creature falls [[prone]] and takes 28 (**8d6**) bludgeoning damage.

If the hellfire engine remains in the [[prone]] creature's space, the creature is also [[restrained]] until it's no longer in the same space as the hellfire engine. While [[restrained]] in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature is shunted to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the hellfire engine and is no longer [[restrained]].

**Hellfire Weapons.** The hellfire engine uses one of the following options:

- **Bonemelt Sprayer:** The hellfire engine spews acidic flame in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (**2d10**) fire damage plus 18 (**4d8**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the saving throw are drenched in burning acid and take 5 (**1d10**) fire damage plus 9 (**2d8**) acid damage at the end of their turns. An affected creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can take an action to scrape off the burning fuel.
- **Lightning Flail:** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. @h18 (**3d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (**5d8**) lightning damage. Up to three other creatures of the hellfire engine's choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**5d8**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Thunder Cannon:** The hellfire engine targets a point within 120 feet of it that it can see. Each creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (**5d10**) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (**2d12**) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If the chosen option kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in `1d4` hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a [[wish]] spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.
