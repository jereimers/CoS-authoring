# Conjure Elemental

*5th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

You conjure a Large, intangible spirit from the Elemental Planes that appears in an unoccupied space within range. Choose the spirit's element, which determines its damage type: air (Lightning), earth (Thunder), fire (Fire), or water (Cold). The spirit lasts for the duration.

Whenever a creature you can see enters the spirit's space or starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw if the spirit has no creature [[Restrained|XPHB]]. On failed save, the target takes **8d8** damage of the spirit's type, and the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the spell ends. At the start of each of its turns, the [[Restrained|XPHB]] target repeats the save. On a failed save, the target takes **4d8** damage of the spirit's type. On a successful save, the target isn't [[Restrained|XPHB]] by the spirit.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `8d8;4d8` for each spell slot level above 5.
