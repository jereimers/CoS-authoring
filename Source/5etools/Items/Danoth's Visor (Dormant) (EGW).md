# Danoth's Visor (Dormant)

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot [[invisible]] enemies and scout areas from afar.

## Dormant

While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) and Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.
