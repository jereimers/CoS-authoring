# Bestow Curse

*3rd-level necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

You touch a creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration. Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:

- Choose one ability. The target has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.
- The target has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against you.
- In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the [[Dodge|XPHB]] action on that turn.
- If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra **1d8** Necrotic damage.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain [[Concentration]] on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require [[Concentration]], and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5-6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7-8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.
