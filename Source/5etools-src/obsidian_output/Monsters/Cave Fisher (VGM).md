## Traits

**Adhesive Filament.** The cave fisher can use its action to extend a sticky filament up to 60 feet, and the filament adheres to anything that touches it. A creature adhered to the filament is [[grappled]] by the cave fisher (escape DC 13), and ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage. The filament can be attacked (AC 15; 5 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage), but a weapon that fails to sever it becomes stuck to it, requiring an action and a successful DC 13 Strength check to pull free. Destroying the filament causes no damage to the cave fisher, which can extrude a replacement filament on its next turn

**Flammable Blood.** If the cave fisher drops to half its hit points or fewer, it gains vulnerability to fire damage.

**Spider Climb.** The cave fisher can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cave fisher makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Filament.** One creature [[grappled]] by the cave fisher's adhesive filament must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw, provided that the target weighs 200 pounds or less. On a failure, the target is pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cave fisher, and the cave fisher makes a claw attack against it as a bonus action. Reeling up the target releases anyone else who was attached to the filament. Until the grapple ends on the target, the cave fisher can't extrude another filament.
