## Traits

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Naergoth has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Naergoth makes three attacks, either with his longsword or longbow. He can use Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

**Life Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h20 (**5d6 + 3**) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) slashing damage, or 10 (**1d10 + 5**) if used with two hands, plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 1**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage.
