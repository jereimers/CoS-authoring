## Traits

**Caramelization.** If the horror takes fire damage, it releases a sweet, mesmerizing scent. Each creature within 30 feet of the horror must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[charmed]] condition. A [[charmed]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Magic Resistance.** The horror has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The horror makes one Bite attack and two Candy Cane attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) acid damage.

**Candy Cane.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, the horror can choose to deal no damage; instead, the target has the [[prone]] condition, and the horror can pull the target up to 5 feet toward itself.
