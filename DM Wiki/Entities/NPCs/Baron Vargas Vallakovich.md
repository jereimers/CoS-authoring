# Who they are

Descended from the original founders of the settlement, Vargas Vallakovich is an entitled, narcissistic, blue-blooded noble with a bad temper, delusions of salvation, and a praise kink (*but you didn't hear that from me*).

# What the party knows

- Ever since [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s awakening three months ago, he has instituted weekly festivals and made attendance mandatory. 
- He has decreed that the [[Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]] will be held in the town square ([[Town Square]]) on [[Neyavr 7]]. The previous festival, which he called the Wolf's Head Jamboree, was less than a week ago.
- He lives with his wife and two large dogs in a mansion on the south side of town.

# Notes

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Vargas should inspire frustration with his obstinance, disgust for his narcissistic arrogance, and mild amusement for his utter and ridiculous self-assurance.

### Emotions
Vargas most often feels annoyed, offended, satisfied, outraged, impatient, or smug.

### Motivations
Vargas wants to secure his power free from Strahd's influence and lead Vallaki to escape the Mists by forcing everyone in the town to be happy.

### Inspirations
When playing Vargas, channel Lord Farquaad (Shrek), Joffrey Baratheon (Game of Thrones), and Governor Ratcliffe (Pocahontas).

### Vocal Notes
*I'm playing him like Russell Edgington (True Blood) and Uncle Baby Billy (The Righteous Gemstones)*
- *says "vamper" and "spurrit"*

### Signature Lines
"All will be well!"
"The heavens will see our joy and wealth and look favorably upon us," he crows. "Through our good spirits, we shall move ever-closer to our freedom from this fell darkness."
he cares little for the plight of a “Vistani whelp.”

## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Vargas is an entitled, narcissistic, blue-blooded noble with a bad temper, delusions of salvation, and a love for praise and adoration.

### Morale
In a fight, Vargas would command his dogs, Claw and Fang, as well as [[Izek Strazni]] and any present guards to seize any who oppose him. If deprived of his defenders, Vargas would either attempt to flee, or—if flight were obstructed—grovel pathetically at the feet of his attacker, begging for mercy.

### Relationships
Vargas, the burgomaster of Vallaki, is the father of [[Victor Vallakovich]], the husband of Baroness Lydia Petrovna, the brother-in-law of [[Father Lucian Petrovich]], and the son of the late Baron Valentin Vallakovich. He is also the employer and adoptive "father" of [[Izek Strazni]], his captain of the guard and chief enforcer.

### Knowledge
Can share with players during scene in his library:
* For the past two months, a spirit has haunted the Vallakovich mansion. 
* Servants have seen its reflection in mirrors or darkened windows, and have reported cold drafts, strange sounds, and objects that move of their own volition.
* The mansion’s butler and the baroness' lady-in-waiting have already left the Baron's employment, too fearful of the ghost to continue working in the house.
* The Baron’s wife, Baroness Lydia Petrovna, hosts daily lunches for a group of Vallakian women, who Vargas uses to prepare costumes and decorations for his weekly festivals. Vargas is desperate to ensure that the women remain ignorant of the spirit’s existence.
* The Baron's cook, a doughty woman named Tereska, has seen the spirit most recently, and nearly quit her job before the Baron convinced her to stay by (reluctantly) increasing her pay.
