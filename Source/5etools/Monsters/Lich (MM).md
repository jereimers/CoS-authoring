## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Rejuvenation.** If it has a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in `1d10` days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.

**Turn Resistance.** The lich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.


## Actions

**Paralyzing Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**3d6**) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Cantrip.** The lich casts a cantrip.

**Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).** The lich uses its Paralyzing Touch.

**Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).** The lich fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for the next 24 hours.

**Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).** Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of the lich must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (**6d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
