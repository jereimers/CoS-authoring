## Traits

**Echolocation.** The whale can't use its blindsight while [[deafened]].

**Hold Breath.** The whale can hold its breath for 90 minutes.

**Keen Hearing.** The whale has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on hearing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The whale makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d8 + 8**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the whale. A swallowed creature has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the whale, and it takes 3 (**1d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the whale's turns. If the whale takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the whale must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the whale. If the whale dies, a swallowed creature can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d6 + 8**) bludgeoning damage, or 37 (**6d6 + 16**) bludgeoning damage if the target is an object.
