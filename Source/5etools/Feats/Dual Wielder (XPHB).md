# Dual Wielder

**Prerequisites:** Level 4, STR 13+, Level 4, DEX 13+

You gain the following benefits.

## Enhanced Dual Wielding

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action on your turn and attack with a weapon that has the L property, you can make one extra attack as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] later on the same turn with a different weapon, which must be a Melee weapon that lacks the 2H property. You don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative.

## Quick Draw

You can draw or stow two weapons that lack the 2H property when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
