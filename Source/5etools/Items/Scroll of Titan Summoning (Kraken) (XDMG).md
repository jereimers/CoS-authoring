# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Kraken)

*Item, Legendary*

When you take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to read this scroll, a [[Kraken|XMM]] appears in an unoccupied space in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. A [[kraken|XMM]] requires a body of water large enough to contain it, or the summoning fails and the scroll is wasted

The [[Kraken|XMM]] is [[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. If the [[Kraken|XMM]] is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
