# Horn of Blasting

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **5d8** Thunder damage and has the [[Deafened|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] that aren't being worn or carried take **10d8** Thunder damage.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20% chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals **10d6** Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.
