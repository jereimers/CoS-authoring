# Sleep

*1st-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sand or rose petals)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have [[Immunity|XPHB]] to the [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.
