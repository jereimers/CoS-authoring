# Fairy Trickster

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Faerie Trod Trotter

When you take the [[Disengage|XPHB]] action on your turn, [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]] doesn't cost you extra movement for the rest of that turn.

## Flustering Strike

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can attempt to fluster the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat and your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on saving throws until the end of your next turn.

You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
