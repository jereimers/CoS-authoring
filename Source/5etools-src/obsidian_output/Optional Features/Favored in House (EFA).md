# Favored in House

You can request a favor from your house, which can take one of the following forms:

- A member of the house casts for you a different spell of level 3 or lower at half the usual cost.

You can request such a favor a number of times equal to your Renown Score. If your Renown Score falls below the total number of favors you have requested, a higher-ranking member of the house might call in a favor from you, sending you on a mission for house or personal business.

In addition, your house pays you a stipend that supports your Modest lifestyle (1 GP per day).
