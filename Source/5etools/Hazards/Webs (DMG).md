# Webs

Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled areas are difficult terrain. Moreover, a creature entering a webbed area for the first time on a turn or starting its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become [[restrained]] by the webs. A [[restrained]] creature can use its action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength ([[Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check.

Each 10-foot cube of giant webs has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire, and immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and psychic damage.
