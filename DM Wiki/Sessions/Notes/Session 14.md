%% A session is a unit of play in which the players meet in person, enact one or more scenes/encounters, and then adjourn. Sessions have recaps and dates, and can span across boundaries of arc/act. %%

We pick up at Wachterhaus, as dinner with Lady Fiona is about to begin.

>[!note]+ SESSION NOTE
>Since we'll be playing at the bar, I expect the Dinner to take the majority of our time. A fine place to end would be at **The Players Return**, below, when they discover the Blue Water Inn was ransacked. If we reach this point earlier than expected, it's fine to continue into Neyavr 5 with the 3 Options detailed later in this document.

# Neyavr 4, Dinnertime

## Return to the [[Blue Water Inn]]

> [!note]+ DM NOTE
>
>Izek has only seen Ireena in the context of the party (never by herself). The party was known to be aiding Father Lucian after the church was damaged, so it wouldn't be weird for them to be repeatedly visiting the church. They are also know to be staying at the Blue Water Inn, so it's fair to say that Izek assumed Ireena would be staying at the inn along with the party (and not at the church, which is obviously not a place at which most people would take up temporary residence). His INT and WIS are also super low (10 and 9, respectively) so he couldn't have thought that hard about it.
### Izek's Visit

### The Players Return
![[Arc G - The Strazni Siblings#G1b. The Players Return]]

## The Next Morning (Neyavr 5)

>[!note]+ DM NOTE:
>Ernst reflecting on having had coffee from a Vistana caravan is very funny given that Arden supplied coffee (or maybe ashes) at the [[Tser Pool Encampment|Tser Pool]] on the morning of [[Neyavr 2]] in [[Session 07 - The Tarokka Reading#Leaving Camp]]. 

![[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish#F3. Return to the Blue Water Inn]]


# Neyavr 5, Option 1: Plant the poisoned wine, kill [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] (Arc F)

# Neyavr 5, Option 2: Seek out [[Van Richten's Tower|Khazan's Tower]] (Arc E)

## Lake Zarovich (Szoldar & Yevgeni's Hunting Shack)

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E4. Lake Zarovich]]

## The Svalich Road, Luna River Bridge, & Crossroads

>[!note]+ DM NOTE
>Since none of my players have a passive perception this high, ask for a perception check when they leave Szoldar's hunting shack. Keep the DC at 19.
>
>Also, skip the encounter with the Scarecrows and Twig Blights, since we already did that. But do the scrap of material at the bridge.


![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E5. The Svalich Road]]


## Lake Baratok, Ezmerelda's Wagon, The Tower

>[!tip]+ DESCRIPTION OF THE LAKE & TOWER
>You come to a cold mountain lake enclosed by misty woods and rocky bluffs. Thick fog creeps across the dark, still waters. The trail ends at a grass-covered causeway that stretches a hundred yards across the lake to a flat, marshy island with a stone tower on it. The tower is old and decrepit, with collapsing scaffolds clinging to one side where a large gash has split the wall. Timeworn griffon statues, their wings and flanks covered with moss, perch atop buttresses that support the walls. Parked near the base of the tower, within sight of the entrance, is a barrel-topped wagon spattered with mud.
### Ezmerelda's Wagon

>[!tldr]+ DESCRIPTION OF EZMERELDA'S WAGON
> Under layers of mud, this wagon sports a fresh coat of purple paint, and its wheels have fancy gold trim. A brass lantern hangs from each corner, and red drapes cover a tombstone-shaped window on each side. A steel padlock secures the back door, hanging from which are three cheap wooden signs arranged in a haphazard diagonal that read, in order, "Keep out!" "Home & Property of Ezmerelda D'Avenir," and "Trespassers will be immediately incinerated." Beneath the warning on the third sign, someone has drawn a small frowning face with crossed-out eyes, surrounded by a stylized flame.

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E6a. Ezmerelda’s Wagon]]

### The Tower
>[!tldr]+ DESCRIPTION OF THE TOWER DOOR
>The tower door is made of iron, with no visible handles or hinges. In the middle of the door is a large, embossed, blank red seal. Carved into the lintel above the door is a word: Khazan.

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E6b. The Tower]]
