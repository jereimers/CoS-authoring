## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The imp has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Sting.** m +5, reach 5 ft. @h**1d6 + 3** Piercing damage plus **2d6** Poison damage.

**Invisibility.** The imp has the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. This effect ends early immediately after the imp makes an attack roll or deals damage, or if the imp has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.

**Shape-Shift.** The imp shape-shifts to resemble a rat ([[Speed|XPHB]] 20 ft.), a raven (20 ft., Fly 60 ft.), or a spider (20 ft., Climb 20 ft.), or it returns to its true form. Its game statistics are the same in each form, except for its [[Speed|XPHB]]. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
