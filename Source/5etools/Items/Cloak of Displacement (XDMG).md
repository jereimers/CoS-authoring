# Cloak of Displacement

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While you wear this cloak, it magically projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while your [[Speed|XPHB]] is 0.
