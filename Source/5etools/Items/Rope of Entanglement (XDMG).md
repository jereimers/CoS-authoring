# Rope of Entanglement

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target [[Restrained|XPHB]] by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer [[Restrained|XPHB]] by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. If the rope drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it is destroyed.
