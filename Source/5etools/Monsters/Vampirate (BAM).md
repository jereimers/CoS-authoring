## Traits

**Explode.** When the vampirate is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a cloud of ash. Any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (**1d10**) necrotic damage.

**Spider Climb.** The vampirate can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Unusual Nature.** The vampirate doesn't require air or drink.


## Actions

**Energy Drain.** Attack (ms,rs) +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one creature. @h11 (**2d10**) necrotic damage. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies and instantly transforms into a free-willed shadow under the DM's control.

**Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d8 + 2**) piercing damage.
