## Traits

**Amphibious.** The frog can breathe air and water.

**Standing Leap.** The frog's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the frog can't bite another target.

**Swallow.** The frog makes one bite attack against a Small or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the frog, and it takes 5 (**2d4**) acid damage at the start of each of the frog's turns. The frog can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the frog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
