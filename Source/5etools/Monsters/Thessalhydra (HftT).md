## Actions

**Multiattack.** The thessalhydra makes one maw attack and one Flurry of Bites.

**Flurry of Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 10 (**4d4**) poison damage.

**Maw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) acid damage.

**Tail Pincer.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d12 + 4**) slashing damage, and the target is [[grappled]]. As an action, the target can escape the grapple by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength ([[Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check (its choice). Until this grapple ends, the thessalhydra can't use its tail pincer.

**Acid Saliva {@recharge 5}.** The thessalhydra spits a glob of acid at a point it can see within 30 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
