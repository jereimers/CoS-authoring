# K33. King's Apartment Stair

<div class="description"><p>This dark hall is concealed behind two secret doors.</p>

<p>This arched corridor has been swept clean. Oak paneling decorates the walls to a height of four feet. Mounted on the east wall above the wood paneling are three unlit oil lamps spaced ten feet apart. A plain wooden door is set into the west wall, and light seeps through its cracks. A staircase at the north end of the west wall ascends into darkness.</p></div>

The staircase climbs 40 feet to area K45. The door in the west wall opens into area K32.
