# Mythal Touched

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

## Mythal Ward

If a spell attack hits you or you fail a saving throw against a spell, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to roll on the Mythal-Touched [[Magic|XPHB]] table to create a magical effect. If an effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus the modifier of the ability increased by this feat and your [[Proficiency|XPHB]].

You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

**Mythal-Touched Magic**

| 1d20 | Effect |
|---|---|
| 1-2 | You and each creature within 15 feet of you make a Dexterity saving throw, taking Force damage equal to `1d8` times the level of the triggering spell on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 3-7 | You and the triggering spell's caster form a telepathic link for 1 hour. |
| 8-10 | Gravity is reversed in a 15-foot-radius, 60-foot-tall [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on you for 1 minute, per the [[Reverse Gravity|XPHB]] spell. |
| 11-13 | You and the triggering spell's caster each make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[Stunned|XPHB]] condition until the end of its next turn. |
| 14-17 | You gain a +2 bonus to AC for 1 minute, potentially turning the triggering spell into a miss if it was a spell attack. |
| 18-19 | Any flammable, nonmagical object within 10 feet of the triggering spell's caster that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame, takes **1d4** Fire damage, and is burning. |
| 20 | The triggering spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], or [[Reaction|XPHB]] used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't expended. |
