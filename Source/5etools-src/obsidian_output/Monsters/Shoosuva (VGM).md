## Traits

**Rampage.** When it reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the shoosuva can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The shoosuva makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail stinger.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h26 (**4d10 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Tail Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]]. While [[poisoned]], the target is also [[paralyzed]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
