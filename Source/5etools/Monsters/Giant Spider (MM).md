## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (**2d8**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.

**Web {@recharge 5}.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. @hThe target is [[restrained]] by webbing. As an action, the [[restrained]] target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
