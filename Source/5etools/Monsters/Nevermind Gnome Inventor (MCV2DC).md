## Traits

**Always Thinking Ahead.** The inventor has advantage on initiative rolls.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The inventor makes two Flying Fangtrap attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Thunderscream Gadget if it's available.

**Flying Fangtrap.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) piercing damage, and the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of the inventor's next turn.

**Thunderscream Gadget {@recharge 5}.** The inventor produces a gadget that emits a screeching wave of sound in a 30-foot cone originating from the inventor. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Flash Powder.** If the inventor is damaged by a creature it can see within 15 feet of itself, the inventor retaliates by flinging brilliantly explosive powder at the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn.
