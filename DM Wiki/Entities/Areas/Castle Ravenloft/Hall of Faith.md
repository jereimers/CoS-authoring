# K14. Hall of Faith

%% --- Page 77 --- %%
<div class="description"><p>This grand hall is choked with dust and stretches into darkness ahead. Webs hang from the arched ceiling like drapes, and life-sized statues of knights line the hallway on both sides, their eyes seeming to watch you.</p></div>

The statues are harmless. Their moving eyes are a simple optical illusion.
Double doors stand at both ends of the hall. Above the doors leading to area K15 hangs a symbol of beaten bronze that looks like a rising or setting sun.
