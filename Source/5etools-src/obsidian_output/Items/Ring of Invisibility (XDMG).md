# Ring of Invisibility

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to give yourself the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition. You remain [[Invisible|XPHB]] until the ring is removed or until you take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to become visible again.
