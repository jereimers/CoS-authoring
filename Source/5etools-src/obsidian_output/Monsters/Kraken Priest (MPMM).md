## Traits

**Amphibious.** The priest can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The priest makes two Thunderous Touch or Thunderbolt attacks.

**Thunderous Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h27 (**5d10**) thunder damage.

**Thunderbolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d10**) lightning damage plus 11 (**2d10**) thunder damage, and the target is knocked [[prone]].

**Voice of the Kraken (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** A kraken speaks through the priest with a thunderous voice audible within 300 feet. Creatures of the priest's choice that can hear the kraken's words (which are spoken in Abyssal, Infernal, or Primordial) must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the priest for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
