# Ball Bearings

*Item, None*

As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can spill Ball Bearings from their pouch. They spread to cover a level, 10-foot-square area within 10 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Ball Bearings.
