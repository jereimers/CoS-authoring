# Shapechange

*9th-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth 1,500+ GP)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

---

You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form must be of a creature that has a [[Challenge Rating|XPHB]] no higher than your level or [[Challenge Rating|XPHB]]. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.

When you cast the spell, you gain a number of [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the [[Hit Points|XPHB]] of the first form into which you shape-shift. These [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] vanish if any remain when the spell ends.

Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; [[Hit Points|XPHB]]; [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]]; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.

Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.
