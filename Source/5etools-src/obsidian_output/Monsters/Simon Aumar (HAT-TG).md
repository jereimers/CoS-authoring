## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Simon has advantage on saving throws he makes to avoid or end the [[charmed]] condition on himself, and magic can't put him to sleep.

**Special Equipment.** Simon carries a [[bag of holding]], two pairs of [[sending stones]], and a deathly token (see Spellcasting).

**Wild Magic.** When Simon takes 20 or more damage from a single source or takes damage from a critical hit, he must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in the Player's Handbook.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Simon makes three Quarterstaff or Chaos Bolt attacks. He can replace one attack with one use of Spellcasting.

**Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h2 (**1d6 - 1**) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (**1d8 - 1**) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands, plus 11 (**2d10**) force damage.

**Chaos Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) damage of a random type determined by rolling a `d8`: 1, acid; 2, cold; 3, fire; 4, force; 5, lightning; 6, poison; 7, psychic; 8, thunder.



## Reactions

**Sheltering Shield (3/Day).** When Simon or another creature he can see within 10 feet of himself would take damage, he conjures a shimmering, 10-foot-radius sphere of magical force centered on himself. Creatures inside the sphere have resistance to the damage that triggered this reaction.
