# Bait and Switch

When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one Superiority Die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and doesn't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition. This movement doesn't provoke [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]].

Roll the Superiority Die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.
