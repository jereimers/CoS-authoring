A stroke of lightning forming a 100-foot-long, 5-foot-wide [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **8d6** Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `8d6` for each spell slot level above 3.
