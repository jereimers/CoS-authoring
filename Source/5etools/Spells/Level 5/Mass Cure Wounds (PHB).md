# Mass Cure Wounds

*5th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to `3d8` + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by `3d8` for each slot level above 5th.
