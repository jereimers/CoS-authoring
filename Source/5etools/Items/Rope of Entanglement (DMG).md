# Rope of Entanglement

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become [[restrained]].

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target [[restrained]] by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the creature is no longer [[restrained]] by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
