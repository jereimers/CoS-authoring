## Traits

**Axiomatic Mind.** The septon can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Combat Ready.** The septon has advantage on initiative checks.

**Disintegration.** If the septon dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind anything it was carrying.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The septon makes four Tentacle attacks and uses Lightning Network or Spellcasting.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the septon can't use this tentacle against other targets. The septon has seven tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Lightning Network.** The septon conjures a field of electricity that fills a 30-foot cube originating from itself before dissipating. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (**6d10**) lightning damage and has the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
