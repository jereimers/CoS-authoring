# Greater Mark of Scribing

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Improved Intuition

When you use the Gifted Scribe benefit of your [[Mark of Scribing|EFA]] feat, you can roll `1d6` instead of `1d4`.

## Inspired Scribing

When you cast [[Comprehend Languages|XPHB]], you can modify the spell to encompass up to three willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Each chosen creature also gains the benefits of the spell for the duration. In addition, for the duration of the spell, you and the chosen creatures can communicate telepathically with each other while within 1 mile of each other. Once you modify the spell with this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
