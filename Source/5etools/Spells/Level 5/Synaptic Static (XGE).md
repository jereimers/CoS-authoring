# Synaptic Static

*5th-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes **8d6** psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it rolls a `d6` and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain [[concentration]]. The target can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
