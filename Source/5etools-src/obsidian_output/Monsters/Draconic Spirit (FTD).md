## Traits

**Shared Resistances.** When you summon the dragon, choose one of its damage resistances. You have resistance to the chosen damage type until the spell ends.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes a number of Rend attacks equal to half the spell's level (rounded down), and it uses Breath Weapon.

**Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h**1d6 + 4 + summonSpellLevel** piercing damage.

**Breath Weapon.** The dragon exhales destructive energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes **2d6** damage of a type this dragon has resistance to (your choice) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
