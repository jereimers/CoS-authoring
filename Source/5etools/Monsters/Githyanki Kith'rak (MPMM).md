## Actions

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage plus 17 (**5d6**) psychic damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Astral Step {@recharge 4}.** The githyanki teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Rally the Troops.** The githyanki magically ends the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions on itself and each creature of its choice that it can see within 30 feet of it.


## Reactions

**Parry.** The githyanki adds 4 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the githyanki must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
