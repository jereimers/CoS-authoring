## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The squidling has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h5 (**2d4**) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 7) and must succeed on a DC 7 Intelligence saving throw or be [[stunned]] until this grapple ends.

**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [[incapacitated]] creature [[grappled]] by the squidling. @h27 (**5d10**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the squidling kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Tickle {@recharge 5}.** The squidling magically emits psychic energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 7 Intelligence saving throw or take 2 (**1d4**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn.
