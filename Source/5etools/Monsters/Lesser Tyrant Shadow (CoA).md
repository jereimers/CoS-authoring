## Traits

**Empath.** The shadow uses telepathy to sense nearby creatures. The shadow can see a creature if that creature has thoughts and is within the range of the shadow's telepathy. The shadow can't see creatures immune to telepathy.

**Undying Connection.** The shadow was originally spawned from a specific devil and, if the shadow is slain, it returns to life in 10 (`1d20`) days within 1 mile of that devil. The shadow is killed permanently only if its progenitor devil is slain first.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The shadow makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) necrotic damage, plus 3 (**1d6**) psychic damage.

**Cloak of Shadows.** The shadow bends darkness around itself, and now has the [[invisible]] condition for 1 minute. The invisibility ends if the shadow is subjected to a [[Daylight]] spell or similar.

**Empathic Link.** The shadow attempts to form a link between itself and a creature it can see. The target must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw, taking 6 (**1d12**) psychic damage on a success. On a failed save, the creature and the shadow are linked. While linked, every time the shadow is damaged, the creature takes half of that damage as psychic damage. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 6 (**1d12**) psychic damage on a failed save, or ending the effect on a successful one.


## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The shadow transforms into a Beast, Humanoid or Fiend that it has an Empathic Link with, or back into its true form. In a new form, the shadow retains its alignment, hit points, hit dice, telepathy, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features, lair actions, or legendary actions of that form.
