# Assassin's Blood

*Item, None*

A creature subjected to Assassin's Blood makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6 (**1d12**) Poison damage and has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
