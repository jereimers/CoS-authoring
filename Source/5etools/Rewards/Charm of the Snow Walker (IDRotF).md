# Charm of the Snow Walker

*Charm*

*This charm can be bestowed by a {@creature chwinga* living in Icewind Dale or other cold regions by using their Magical Gift action.}

This charm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 of the charm's charges to gain the following benefits for 24 hours:

- You and your allies within 15 feet of you ignore difficult terrain caused by snow or ice.
- You can see through areas heavily obscured by snow to a distance of 60 feet.
- You are immune to the effects of extreme cold, as described in the [[Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG]] (though you gain no protection from cold damage).

Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.
