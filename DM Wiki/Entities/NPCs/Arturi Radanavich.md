# Who they are

Arturi Radanavich is a dark and brooding [[Vistani]] traveler who bears a terrible curse: each night, he is hunted by the undead. Despite his grim circumstances, he remains surprisingly philosophical, viewing his plight through the lens of allegory and hard-won wisdom.

# What the party knows

- Arturi is a [[Vistani]] traveler who carries a faint whiff of undeath about him
- He is cursed to be hunted by undead every night
- To protect others from his curse, he spends each evening hiding in a large tree until the attacks cease
- He participated in the Game of Stories, telling [[Arturi's Tale]]—an allegorical story about a Fox, Sparrows, and Rats that illustrated how vengeance begets vengeance and ultimately destroys all
- He helped mediate tensions between [[Arden Nalero|Arden]] and [[Eliza]] when the party suspected her of being a servant of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]

# Personality

- Dark and brooding, bearing the weight of his curse with stoic resignation
- Philosophical and prone to speaking in allegories
- Despite his grim demeanor, shows genuine care for others' safety
- Possesses a sardonic wit that occasionally breaks through his melancholy

# Where we've seen them
