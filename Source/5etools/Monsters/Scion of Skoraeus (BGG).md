## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (6/Day).** If the scion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The scion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The scion deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The scion makes one Crystal Club attack and two Slam attacks, then uses Entombing Grasp if available. Alternatively, the scion makes two Runic Boulder attacks.

**Crystal Club.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h35 (**4d12 + 9**) bludgeoning damage. @homThe scion can cause the club to flare with bright light, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (**4d8**) radiant damage and have the [[blinded]] condition until the start of the scion's next turn.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h31 (**4d10 + 9**) force damage.

**Runic Boulder.** Ranged Weapon Attack +16 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. @h27 (**4d8 + 9**) bludgeoning damage. @homThe boulder explodes. The target and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 19 (**3d12**) force damage and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**Entombing Grasp {@recharge}.** The scion wreathes its hand in petrifying magic and touches one Huge or smaller creature it can see within 20 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (**8d6**) force damage and have the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 19). At the start of the scion's next turn, if the target is still [[grappled]], the target has the [[petrified]] condition.


## Bonus Actions

**Earth-Shaking Movement.** The scion moves up to its speed and then sends a shock wave through the ground in a 60-foot radius circle centered on itself. Each creature on the ground in that area that is [[concentration]] must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or lose [[concentration]].
