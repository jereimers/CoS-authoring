# Coalition Pidgin

**Type:** Standard  
**Script:** None  
**Typical Speakers:** Brazen Coalition, {@race Human (Ixalan)|PSX|Humans}, {@race Orc (Ixalan)|PSX|Orcs}, {@race Siren|PSX|Sirens}, {@race Goblin (Ixalan)|PSX|Goblins}

The humans of the Brazen Coalition speak a different language—a pidgin of Orc, Siren, and a native human language that is similar to [[Vampire|PSX]] (about as closely related as Italian is to Spanish). Orcs, sirens, and goblins also speak this Brazen Coalition pidgin.
