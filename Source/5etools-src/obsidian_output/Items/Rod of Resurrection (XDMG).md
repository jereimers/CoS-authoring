# Rod of Resurrection

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can cast one of the following spells from it: [[Heal|XPHB]] (expends 1 charge) or [[Resurrection|XPHB]] (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.
