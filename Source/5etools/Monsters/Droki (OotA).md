## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Droki wears [[boots of speed]].

**Insanity.** Droki has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]].

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** Droki deals an extra 7 (**2d6**) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Droki that isn't [[incapacitated]] and Droki doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Magic Resistance.** The derro has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the derro has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Droki makes two attacks with his shortsword

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage. The sword is coated with serpent venom that wears off after the first hit. A target subjected to the venom must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Parry.** Droki adds 3 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, Droki must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
