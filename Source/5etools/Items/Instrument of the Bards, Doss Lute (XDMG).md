# Instrument of the Bards, Doss Lute

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement by a bard)*

An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take **2d4** Psychic damage.

You can play the Doss [[Lute|XPHB]] to cast one of the following spells: [[Fly|XPHB]], [[Invisibility|XPHB]], [[Levitate|XPHB]], [[Protection from Evil and Good|XPHB]], [[Animal Friendship|XPHB]], [[Protection from Energy|XPHB]] (Fire damage only), and [[Protection from Poison|XPHB]]. Once the Doss [[Lute|XPHB]] has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
