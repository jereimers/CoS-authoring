## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The quavilithku has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The quavilithku can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** When in contact with a web, the quavilithku knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The quavilithku ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The quavilithku makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 17 (**5d6**) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, a creature can't regain hit points. A [[poisoned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Dissolving Web {@recharge 5}.** The quavilithku expels acid-drenched webs in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (**8d10**) acid damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take 44 (**8d10**) acid damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Assess Weakness.** The quavilithku sizes up a creature it can see within 40 feet of itself. Until the start of the quavilithku's next turn, it has advantage on attack rolls against the creature.
