## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The mind flayer can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the mind flayer has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**Unusual Nature.** The mind flayer doesn't require air, food, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The mind flayer makes two Claw attacks or one Claw attack and one Tentacles attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage.

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15).

**Drink Sapience.** The mind flayer targets one creature it is grappling. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) psychic damage and gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. The mind flayer regains a number of hit points equal to the psychic damage dealt. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the psychic damage dies.


## Bonus Actions

**Disrupt Psyche {@recharge 5}.** The mind flayer magically emits psionic energy in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [[incapacitated]] for 1 minute. The [[incapacitated]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
