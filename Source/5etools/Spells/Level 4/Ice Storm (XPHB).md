*4th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 300 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a mitten)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range. Each creature in the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes **2d10** Bludgeoning damage and **4d6** Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] into [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]] until the end of your next turn.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The Bludgeoning damage increases by `2d8` for each spell slot level above 4.
