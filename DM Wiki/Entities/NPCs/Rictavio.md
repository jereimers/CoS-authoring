# Who they are

Rictavio, the lone guest of the Blue Water Inn besides the party, is a colorfully dressed half-elf bard who claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land. He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable. 


# What the party knows
- Rictavio came to the inn just a day before the party. 
- He gave his monkey, Piccolo, as a gift to [[Gadof Blinsky]], the toymaker, and apparently takes food to Blinsky as a means of financial support.
- Has a horse named Drusilla in the stables of the [[Blue Water Inn]]
- Has a carnival wagon parked on the south side of the [[Arasek Stockyard]]
# Personality
- Flamboyant, irreverent, and occasionally narcissistic


# Where we've seen them
- [[Session 09 - Walls Keep Out More Than Wolves]] — he shared the story of Count Belasco (see [[The Ringmaster's Tale]])
- [[Session 11]] — he retrieved a parcel from [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] in the morning, then departed to tend his horse.
