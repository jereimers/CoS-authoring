## Traits

**Evasion.** If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it's [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Force Strike.** Ranged Weapon Attack @hitYourSpellAttack to hit, range 30 ft., one target you can see. @h**1d4 + PB** force damage.



## Reactions

**Channel Magic.** The homunculus delivers a spell you cast that has a range of touch. The homunculus must be within 120 feet of you.
