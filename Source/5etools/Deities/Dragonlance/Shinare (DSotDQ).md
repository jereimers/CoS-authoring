# Shinare

**Pantheon:** Dragonlance  
**Alignment:** Neutral  
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** Griffon's wing

Shinare is the god of wealth, industry, and commerce. Though many of her followers are merchants, her influence spans legitimate and underhanded commerce alike, and she receives occasional worship from thieves. Despite this, most consider her a god of fair dealing; supplicants pray she favors them as they bargain.
