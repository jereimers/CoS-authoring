## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day).** If the dragonborn fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragonborn makes two Greataxe attacks.

**Greataxe.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d12 + 5**) slashing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) necrotic damage.

**Necrotic Breath {@recharge}.** The dragonborn exhales shadowy fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 36 (**8d8**) necrotic damage and is [[frightened]] of the dragonborn for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[frightened]]. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
