# Charm of Euryale

*Charm*

As an action, you can unleash a petrifying wave of magic from your eyes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has the [[petrified]] condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, a creature is partially turned to stone and has the [[restrained]] condition. A [[restrained]] creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this charm, it vanishes from you.
