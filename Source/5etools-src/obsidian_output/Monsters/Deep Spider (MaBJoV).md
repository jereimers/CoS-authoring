## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The deep spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the deep spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The deep spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The deep spider makes one Bite attack and two Foreleg attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and has the [[paralyzed]] condition while [[poisoned]] in this way.

**Foreleg.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h19 (**4d6 + 5**) slashing damage.
