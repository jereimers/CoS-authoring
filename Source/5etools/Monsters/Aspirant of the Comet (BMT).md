## Traits

**Hunger of the Void.** When the aspirant is reduced to 0 hit points, its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, are sucked into a void and destroyed. Creatures in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the aspirant must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage and is pulled 10 feet straight toward the aspirant's space. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

**Sinister Devotion.** The aspirant has advantage on saving throws against the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions.


## Actions

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage, or 5 (**1d8 + 1**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
