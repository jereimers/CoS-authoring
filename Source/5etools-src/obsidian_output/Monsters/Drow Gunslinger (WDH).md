## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

**Gunslinger.** Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on the drow's ranged attack rolls with a pistol. In addition, the drow ignores Cover and Cover when making ranged attacks with a pistol.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Poisonous Pistol.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) poison damage.
