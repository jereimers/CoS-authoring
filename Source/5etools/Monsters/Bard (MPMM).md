## Actions

**Multiattack.** The bard makes two Shortsword or Shortbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Cacophony {@recharge 4}.** Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from the bard must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (**2d8**) thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the bard. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.


## Bonus Actions

**Taunt (2/Day).** The bard targets one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next turn.
