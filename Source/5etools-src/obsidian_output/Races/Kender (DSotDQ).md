# Kender

**Size:** Small  
**Speed:** 30  

## Fearless

You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[frightened]] condition on yourself. When you fail a saving throw to avoid or end the [[frightened]] condition on yourself, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you succeed on a saving throw in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Kender Curiosity

Thanks to the mystical origin of your people, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: [[Insight]], [[Investigation]], [[Sleight of Hand]], [[Stealth]], or [[Survival]].

## Taunt

You have an extraordinary ability to fluster creatures. As a bonus action, you can unleash a string of provoking words at a creature within 60 feet of yourself that can hear and understand you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn. The DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (choose when you select this race).

You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
