## Traits

**Mask.** As a bonus action, Valindra can mask her shriveled flesh and appear to be a living elf. This magical illusion lasts until she ends it as a bonus action or until she uses her Frightening Gaze legendary action. The effect also ends if Valindra drops to 30 hit points or fewer, or if [[dispel magic]] is cast on her.

**Preparation.** When preparing her spells, Valindra can swap out any spell on her list of prepared spells for another wizard spell of the same level.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Valindra fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Rejuvenation.** If destroyed Valindra gains a new body in `1d10` days, regaining all her hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.

**Turn Resistance.** Valindra has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.


## Actions

**Paralyzing Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**3d6**) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Cantrip.** Valindra casts a cantrip.

**Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).** Valindra uses her Paralyzing Touch.

**Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).** Valindra fixes her gaze on one creature she can see within 10 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Valindra's gaze for the next 24 hours.

**Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).** Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of Valindra must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (**6d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
