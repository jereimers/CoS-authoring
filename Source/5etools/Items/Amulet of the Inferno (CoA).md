# Amulet of the Inferno

*Wondrous Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement)*

When Fierna was born, petitioners and devils from all over came to celebrate her birth. Many brought gifts and treasures, including a powerful infernal warlock. Recognizing the strength and inner fire of Fierna, the warlock gifted her with the Amulet of the Inferno, and it has been around her neck ever since.

The Amulet of the Inferno is a magic necklace that grants a +3 bonus to spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

## Random Properties

The Amulet of the Inferno has the following random properties:

- 3 [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg]] properties
- 2 [[Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg]] properties

## Infernal Fire

While worn, the amulet augments any magical flames created by you, transforming normal fire into Hellfire. Hellfire ignores resistances and immunities to fire damage and deals double damage to creatures vulnerable to either fire or necrotic damage. It is also capable of melting stone, as well as igniting flammable objects.

## Raging Inferno

While attuned to the Amulet of the Inferno, you may use a bonus action to cast [[Fire Bolt]] or [[Produce Flame]]. The cantrips scale based on your total character level and use Intelligence as a spellcasting modifier if you're normally incapable of casting spells.

## Everburning

The Amulet of the Inferno grants resistance to cold damage and the ability to breathe underwater. Any magical flames you conjure are similarly augmented: they can be used underwater, can't be extinguished through any means, and can exude any temperature. While the casting of a fire spell can still be interrupted with [[Counterspell]], once the spell has been cast, any lingering flames can't be removed.

## Destroying the Amulet

The only creature capable of destroying the amulet is the warlock that created it. Nobody living knows the warlock's identity, making destroying the amulet almost impossible.
