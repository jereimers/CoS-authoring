# Cloak of Many Fashions

*Wondrous Item, Common*

While wearing this cloak, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the garment. The cloak's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the cloak can't be anything but a cloak. Although it can duplicate the appearance of other magic cloaks, it doesn't gain their magical properties.
