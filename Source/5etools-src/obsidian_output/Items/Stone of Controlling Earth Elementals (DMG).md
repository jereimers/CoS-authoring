# Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an [[earth elemental]], as if you had cast the [[conjure elemental]] spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.
