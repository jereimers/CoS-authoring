# Boots of Speed

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While you wear these boots, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your [[Speed|XPHB]], and any creature that makes an [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]] against you has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When you've used the boots' property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
