# Hobgoblin

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Creature Type

You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a goblinoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a goblinoid.

## Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

## Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[charmed]] condition on yourself.

## Fey Gift

You can use this trait to take the [[Help]] action as a bonus action, and you can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Starting at 3rd level, choose one of the options below each time you take the [[Help]] action with this trait:

- **Hospitality:** You and the creature you help each gain a number of temporary hit points equal to `1d6` plus your proficiency bonus.
- **Passage:** You and the creature you help each increase your walking speeds by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
- **Spite:** Until the start of your next turn, the first time the creature you help hits a target with an attack roll, that target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes within the next minute.

## Fortune from the Many

If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can draw on your bonds of reciprocity to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +3). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
