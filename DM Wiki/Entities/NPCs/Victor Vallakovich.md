# Who They Are

Victor Vallakovich is the 18-year-old son of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]], a self-taught wizard who has been secretly studying magic in his attic workroom at the [[DM Wiki/Entities/Areas/Town of Vallaki/Burgomaster's Mansion|Vallakovich Manor]].

# What the Party Knows

From [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

## Background and Magic Studies

- Victor found [[Khazan]]'s spellbook in his father's library several years ago and has been using it to teach himself magic
- His father refused to hire him a proper tutor, so Victor studied arcane magic in secret
- He has converted the manor's attic into a workroom where he practices spells and conducts experiments
- Victor is brilliant but inexperienced, with raw talent that sometimes exceeds his control

## The Teleportation Circle Accident

- Two months ago, Victor attempted to create a teleportation circle to escape [[Barovia]]
- His friend [[Stella Wachter]] was present when the experiment went catastrophically wrong
- The failed teleportation ripped Stella's soul from her body and trapped it in the [[Ethereal Plane]]
- Stella's body remains in [[Wachterhaus]], catatonic, while her soul slowly fades in the ghostly realm
- Victor has been desperately searching for a way to rescue Stella ever since

## Communication with Erasmus

- Several weeks ago, Victor found a message written in frost on his bedroom window: "**Help Victor**"
- He eventually made contact with [[Erasmus]], a ghost in the Ethereal Plane who has been protecting Stella's soul
- Erasmus observed the accident and has been shielding Stella from shadow entities that feed on trapped souls
- Through Erasmus, Victor learned about Stella's condition and the dangers she faces
- Only through Erasmus's protection has Stella survived for two months when she should have faded in days

## The Rescue Plan

- Victor found a ritual in Khazan's book [[Ethereal Entities]] that can temporarily transport living creatures into the Ethereal Plane
- The ritual requires a [[Night Hags|night hag]]'s [[Heartstone|heartstone]] and must be performed on the night of the full moon
- Erasmus has spotted a night hag ([[Morgantha]]) haunting the [[Refugee Camp]] outside [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]
- Victor needs the party's help to obtain the heartstone and rescue Stella before her soul fades completely
- Time is running out—Stella is already forgetting who she is and experiencing strange dissociative episodes

## Khazan's Tower

- Victor revealed that [[Khazan]]'s wizard tower stands on [[Lake Baratok]], west of Vallaki
- The tower features powerful enchantments, including an anti-magic field that prevents other spellcasters from using magic nearby
- A platinum ring bearing Khazan's sigil was found at the site where [[Arabelle]] was abducted
- Victor suspects investigating the tower might reveal clues about Arabelle's disappearance
- He has asked the party to bring back any magical artifacts or tomes they find at the tower for his research

## Deal with the Party

- The party agreed to help Victor rescue Stella's soul
- In exchange, Victor will help them investigate Khazan's tower and Arabelle's abduction
- He has provided them with information about the tower's location and the night hag at the refugee camp
- Victor is desperate but determined—saving Stella has become his singular focus

# Personality

- Brilliant but socially awkward, with little patience for social niceties
- Speaks in a quiet, slightly monotone voice with bursts of intensity when discussing magic or Stella
- Arrogant about his magical knowledge but deeply insecure about his failures
- Fiercely protective of his secrets and his workroom
- Desperate to prove himself and make amends for harming Stella
- Bitter toward his father for refusing to support his magical education
- Wary of strangers but willing to trust those who show genuine desire to help

# Where We've Seen Them

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Raiding the Vallakovich Library (Politely)|Session 13]] — Met in the Vallakovich library; discussed Khazan's spellbook
- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Victor's Workroom|Session 13]] — Showed the party his workroom and explained Stella's predicament

### Vocal Notes


### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Victor is a quiet, moody, and isolated young man with an awkward manner and a total lack of social graces. To those he trusts, Victor is a devoted and compassionate friend, with a spark of brilliance and the stubbornness of a mule. Only Victor knows that he secretly fears losing Stella’s friendship—both due to the harm caused by his *teleportation circle* and due to the time she’s spent with Erasmus van Richten in the Ethereal Plane.

### Morale
In a fight, Victor would attempt to flee, but would resort to his most dangerous spells with wanton and amateurish abandon if cornered or if defending his friends or family.

### Relationships
Victor is the only child of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] and Baroness Lydia Petrovna. He is a close friend to Stella Wachter, and a friendly (though wary) acquaintance to the ghost of Erasmus van Richten. Victor despises and fears [[Izek Strazni]], who killed Victor’s childhood cat, Murka, by kicking it across a room when it wandered into his path two years ago. (Victor has since reanimated Murka’s skeleton through the use of his *animate dead* spell.)

### Knowledge
If persuaded to aid the players in finding [[Arabelle]], Victor can share the following information:

* Three years ago, he found an old spellbook in his father’s library. He’s used it to study magic ever since.
* The original owner of the spellbook was a mage named [[Khazan]]. The symbol on the cover of the spellbook was his personal sigil.
* Long ago, Khazan built a wizard’s tower, which he imbued with powerful enchantments, including a protective field that prevented any other spellcasters from using magic within its reach.
