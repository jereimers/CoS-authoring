# Dragonborn

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Draconic Ancestry

Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the Draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and [[Damage|XPHB]] [[Resistance|XPHB]] traits as well as your appearance.

**Draconic Ancestors**

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|---|---|
| Black | Acid |
| Blue | Lightning |
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Green | Poison |
| Red | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |
| White | Cold |

## Breath Weapon

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or a 30-foot [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]). On a failed save, a creature takes **1d10** damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by **1d10** when you reach character levels 5 (**2d10**), 11 (**3d10**), and 17 (**4d10**).

You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Damage Resistance

You have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait.

## Darkvision

You have [[Darkvision|XPHB]] with a range of 60 feet.

## Draconic Flight

When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give yourself temporary flight. As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition. During that time, you have a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] equal to your [[Speed|XPHB]]. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
