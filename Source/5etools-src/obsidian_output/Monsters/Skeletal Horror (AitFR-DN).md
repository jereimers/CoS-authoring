## Actions

**Multiattack.** The horror makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d10 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Wave of Bones {@recharge 5}.** The horror crashes into foes like a wave before quickly reforming. Each creature within 10 feet of the horror must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw is also knocked [[prone]].
