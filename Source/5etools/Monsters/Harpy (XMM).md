## Actions

**Claw.** m +3, reach 5 ft. @h6 (**2d4 + 1**) Slashing damage.

**Luring Song.** The harpy sings a magical melody, which lasts until the harpy's [[Concentration]] ends on it. wis DC 11, each Humanoid and Giant in a 300-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the harpy when the song starts. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition until the song ends and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns. While [[Charmed|XPHB]], the target has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition and ignores the Luring Song of other harpies. If the target is more than 5 feet from the harpy, the target moves on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the harpy. It doesn't avoid [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]]; however, before moving into damaging terrain (such as lava or a pit) and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target repeats the save. @actSaveSuccess The target is immune to this harpy's Luring Song for 24 hours.
