## Bonus Actions

**Fey Step.** The fey magically teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Then one of the following effects occurs, based on the fey's chosen mood:

- **Fuming:** The fey has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of this turn.
- **Mirthful:** The fey can force one creature it can see within 10 feet of it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. Unless the save succeeds, the target is [[charmed]] by you and the fey for 1 minute or until the target takes any damage.
