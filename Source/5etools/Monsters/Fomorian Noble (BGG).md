## Actions

**Multiattack.** The fomorian makes three Rod attacks.

**Rod.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (**2d10**) force damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Beguiling Presence.** The fomorian targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[charmed]] condition for 1 minute. An affected target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target becomes immune to all fomorians' Beguiling Presence for the next 24 hours.
