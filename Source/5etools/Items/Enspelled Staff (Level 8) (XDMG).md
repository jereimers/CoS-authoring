# Enspelled Staff (Level 8)

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement by a Spellcaster)*

Bound into this staff is a level 8 spell. The spell is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains `1d6` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [[Quarterstaff|XPHB]].

The spell's saving throw DC is 18, and its attack bonus is +10.
