## Traits

**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If Gorthok takes 27 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Gorthok makes two melee attacks: one with its lightning tusks and one with its thunder hooves.

**Lightning Tusks.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) lightning damage.

**Thunder Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (**2d6**) thunder damage.

**Lightning Bolt {@recharge}.** Gorthok shoots a bolt of lightning at one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
