## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The drider has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the drider to sleep.

**Spider Climb.** The drider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drider has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**Web Walker.** The drider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drider makes three attacks, either with its longsword or its longbow. It can replace one of those attacks with a bite attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h2 (**1d4**) piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) poison damage.
