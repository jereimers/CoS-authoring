## Traits

**Assassinate.** During its first turn, Ghald has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Ghald scores against a [[surprised]] creature is a critical hit.

**Limited Amphibiousness.** Ghald can breathe air and water, but he needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.

**Shark Telepathy.** Ghald can magically command any shark within 120 feet of him, using a limited telepathy.

**Sneak Attack.** Ghald deals an extra 14 (**4d6**) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Ghald's that isn't [[incapacitated]] and Ghald doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ghald makes three attacks, one with his bite and two with his shortswords.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Garrote.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Small creature against which Ghald has advantage on the attack roll. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target can't breathe, and Ghald has advantage on attack rolls against it.
