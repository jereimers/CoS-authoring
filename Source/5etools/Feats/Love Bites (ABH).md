# Love Bites

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Endearing Pain

Immediately after you damage a creature with a Melee weapon or an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]], you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to give the target the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition until the start of your next turn or until you or your allies damage it. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
