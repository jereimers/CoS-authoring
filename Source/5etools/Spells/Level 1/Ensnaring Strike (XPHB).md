# Ensnaring Strike

*1st-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus (which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a weapon)  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on this save. On a failed save, the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.

While [[Restrained|XPHB]], the target takes **1d6** Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
