%% An item is an artifact, relic, piece of equipment or gear that players can obtain and/or interact with. Items have owners, locations, histories, and optional magical qualities and/or stat blocks. %%

# Description
A player seeking **wealth** begins the campaign with an old, chipped *electrum coin* stamped with the profiled visage of a proud, yet cold-looking nobleman. When seen in a certain light, the nobleman's expression seems to change from a firm, aristocratic sneer to a feral, monstrous snarl.

# Notes
The player who possesses the *electrum coin* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the coin first came from a wondrous vault of treasure—a conqueror's hoard—and that, one day, it will lead them to claim riches beyond imagining.

%%
Unbeknownst to the player, the visage stamped upon the *electrum coin* is the face of Strahd von Zarovich, the undead ruler of Barovia. The coin was minted long ago, but spirited away from Strahd's treasuries by a thief shortly before Barovia was lost to the mists. When it senses the presence of Death House, the coin lands on its edge, then begins rolling across the ground toward the house until it reaches the base of its steps.

***Developments.*** Any Barovian immediately recognizes the visage stamped upon the coin as Strahd's. If the player shares the coin's story with one of the Vistani of Madam Eva's camp in [[Arc C - Into the Valley|Arc C - Into the Valley]], Sir Godfrey Gwilym in [[Arc M - The Dragon's Manor]], or Kasimir Velikov in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]], they can learn of Strahd's vast hoard of treasure, collected in his days as a conqueror and hidden away in Castle Ravenloft. 

When the player first approaches Strahd's treasury, the coin lands on its edge and rolls as far as it can toward the treasury's entrance, in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House.
