## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The alhoon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Turn Resistance.** The alhoon has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns Undead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The alhoon makes two Chilling Grasp or Arcane Bolt attacks.

**Chilling Grasp.** Melee Spell Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**4d6**) cold damage, and the alhoon regains 14 hit points.

**Arcane Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h28 (**8d6**) force damage.

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** The alhoon magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (**4d8 + 4**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



## Reactions

**Negate Spell (3/Day).** The alhoon targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, the spell fails, but any spell slots or charges are not wasted.
