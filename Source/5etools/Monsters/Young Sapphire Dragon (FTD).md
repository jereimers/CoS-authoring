## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The dragon can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and can leave a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) thunder damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Debilitating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a pulse of high-pitched, nearly inaudible sound in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 33 (**6d10**) thunder damage and is [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[incapacitated]].
