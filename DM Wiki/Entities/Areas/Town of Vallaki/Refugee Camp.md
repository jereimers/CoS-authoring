# First Description

More than a dozen ramshackle tents have been set up against the palisade wall. Among them, dozens of ragged, emaciated people mill about or sit by low-burning campfires and bedrolls, their hollow gazes watching silently as you approach.

Some of them regard [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] with dull recognition, but none lift a hand in greeting or make any gesture of warmth.

# NPCs met

- [[Emeric]]
