# Extended Spell

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires [[Concentration]], you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on any saving throw you make to maintain that [[Concentration]].
