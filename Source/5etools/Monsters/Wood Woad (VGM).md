## Traits

**Magic Club.** In the wood woad's hand, its club is magical and deals 7 (**3d4**) extra damage (included in its attacks).

**Plant Camouflage.** The wood woad has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks it makes in any terrain with ample obscuring plant life.

**Regeneration.** The wood woad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it is in contact with the ground.

Both trees must be Large or bigger.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wood woad makes two attacks with its club.

**Club.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**4d4 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.
