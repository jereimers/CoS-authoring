## Traits

**Aura of Radiance.** The councilor magically sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The councilor can extinguish or restore this light as a bonus action. If the bright light overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created that darkness is dispelled.

**Magic Resistance.** The councilor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The councilor makes two Radiant Touch attacks.

**Radiant Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) radiant damage.

**Healing Touch (3/Day).** The councilor touches another creature. The target magically regains 18 (`3d8 + 5`) hit points and is freed from one curse afflicting it (councilor's choice).

**Flame Strike (5th-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).** The councilor chooses a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 (**4d6**) fire damage and 14 (**4d6**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the councilor casts this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (its choice) increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 5th.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Touch.** The councilor makes one attack with its Radiant Touch.

**Shimmering Aura (Costs 2 Actions).** The councilor channels positive energy into its Aura of Radiance. Until the end of the councilor's next turn, it sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Any creature that starts its turn in the bright light must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the end of the councilor's next turn.
