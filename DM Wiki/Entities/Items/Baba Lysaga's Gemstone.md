# Baba Lysaga's Gemstone

## Description
A **glowing green gemstone** that animates [[Baba Lysaga's Creeping Hut]], giving the massive wooden structure a semblance of life. This gem was one of **three magical gems** originally buried in the Wizard of Wines vineyard, where they imbued the grapevines with life-giving magic and guaranteed the finest wines.

[[Baba Lysaga]] stole this gem and perverted its magic, using it to animate her wooden hut rather than nurture growing things.

## Properties
- **Type:** Wondrous Item (Gemstone)
- **Effect:** Animates Baba Lysaga's Creeping Hut
- **Rarity:** Legendary (unique)
- **Attunement:** N/A

## Location Within the Hut
The gemstone is contained in a **cavity in the stump**, beneath the rotted floorboards of the hut.

### Accessing the Gem
1. **Rip up the floorboards:** Requires a successful **DC 14 Strength check** or dealing **10 damage** to the floorboards
2. **Remove the gem:** If someone attempts this while the hut is alive, the cavity sprouts wooden teeth, becoming a mouth that bites
   - The creature must make a **DC 20 Dexterity saving throw**
   - **Success:** Claims the stone without getting bitten
   - **Failure:** Takes **10 (3d6) piercing damage** and fails to obtain the gem

## Effect on the Hut
**Removing the gem from the hut renders the hut incapacitated.**

This is the most efficient way to neutralize the Creeping Hut as a threat, as the hut has 263 hit points and formidable attacks.

## Connection to the Wizard of Wines
This gem is one of three that once blessed the Wizard of Wines vineyard:
- The gems made the grapevines healthier and guaranteed the finest wines
- The other two gems may still be at the vineyard or have been stolen by other forces
- Returning this gem to the vineyard would help restore its magical properties

## Notes
- Recovering this gem is connected to the Wizard of Wines questline
- The gem's original purpose (nurturing life) has been corrupted by Baba Lysaga
- Destroying or incapacitating the hut by removing the gem is easier than fighting it directly
- The Keepers of the Feather (wereravens) at the Wizard of Wines would greatly value this gem's return
- The gem glows green, making it visible once the floorboards are removed
