## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ulder makes three melee attacks, only one of which can be with his shield.

**+1 Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage when used with two hands.

**Shield.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage, and Ulder pushes the target 5 feet away from him. Ulder then enters the space vacated by the target. If the target is pushed to within 5 feet of a creature friendly to Ulder, the target provokes an opportunity attack from that creature.



## Reactions

**Guardian Strike.** If an enemy within 5 feet of Ulder attacks a target other than him, Ulder can make a melee attack against that enemy.
