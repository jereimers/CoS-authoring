## Traits

**Adhesive Blossoms.** The thorn slinger adheres to anything that touches it. A Medium or smaller creature adhered to the thorn slinger is also [[grappled]] by it (escape DC 11). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.

At the end of each of the thorn slinger's turns, anything [[grappled]] by it takes 3 (**1d6**) acid damage.

**False Appearance.** While the thorn slinger remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate bush.


## Actions

**Thorns.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. @h8 (**2d6 + 1**) piercing damage.
