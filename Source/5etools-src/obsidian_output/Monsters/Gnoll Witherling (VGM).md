## Traits

**Rampage.** When the witherling reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, it can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The witherling makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its club, or two with its club.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Club.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.



## Reactions

**Vengeful Strike.** In response to a gnoll being reduced to 0 hit points within 30 feet of the witherling, the witherling makes a melee attack.
