## Traits

**Stunning Gaze.** When a creature that can see the gauth's central eye starts its turn within 30 feet of the gauth, the gauth can force it to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw if the gauth isn't [[incapacitated]] and can see the creature. A creature that fails the save is [[stunned]] until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the gauth in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

**Death Throes.** When the gauth dies, the magical energy within it explodes, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (**3d8**) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d8**) piercing damage.

**Eye Rays.** The gauth shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it:

- **1. Devour Magic Ray:** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have one of its magic items lose all magical properties until the start of the gauth's next turn. If the object is a charged item, it also loses `1d4` charges. Determine the affected item randomly, ignoring single-use items such as potions and scrolls.
- **2. Enervation Ray:** The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **3. Pushing Ray:** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet directly away from the gauth and have its speed halved until the start of the gauth's next turn.
- **4. Fire Ray:** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (**4d10**) fire damage.
- **5. Paralyzing Ray:** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **6. Sleep Ray:** The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain [[unconscious]] for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on constructs and undead.
