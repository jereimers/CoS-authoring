# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Elemental Cataclysm)

*Item, Legendary*

When you take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to read this scroll, an [[Elemental Cataclysm|XMM]] appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The [[Elemental Cataclysm|XMM]] is [[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. If the [[Elemental Cataclysm|XMM]] is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
