# Objective
Travel to [[Argynvostholt]] and meet with [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]], who awaits those who would raise their swords against [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]].

# What the Party knows
- At the bridge near [[Tser Falls]], the party encountered a [[Standimir|Revenant]]—an undead knight who introduced himself as a member of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]].
- The revenant said the knights of the Order opposed [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] in life and suggested the party speak with [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]] at Argynvostholt for more information.
- When asked why he couldn't take up arms against Strahd himself, the revenant said only: "Because my commander forbids it, and my spirit is bound from disobeying his will." 
- The revenant advised that Argynvostholt lies "west, beyond the walled town, then south upon the ash-gray path."
- Near the River Ivlis Crossroads, the party found an old watchtower built by the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]]. Inside was a broken silver pendant carved to resemble a dragon—the revenant recognized it but refused to comment on its significance.

# Leads
- [[Argynvostholt]] is located west of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], then south on the "ash-gray path."
- [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]] can provide more information about the Order of the Silver Dragon and their opposition to Strahd.
- The silver dragon pendant found in the watchtower may have significance to the Order.

# Secrets
- The Order of the Silver Dragon was a knightly order led by the silver dragon Argynvost, who opposed Strahd during his conquest of the valley. Strahd slaughtered the Order and desecrated Argynvost's remains.
- Vladimir Horngaard, the Order's commander, has bound his fellow revenants with oaths that forbid them from acting against Strahd—because Vladimir's hatred is so great that he wishes Strahd to suffer eternally in his prison of Barovia.
- Sir Godfrey Gwilym disagrees with Vladimir and hopes to find champions who can defeat Strahd and bring peace to the Order's tormented spirits.
- Restoring Argynvost's skull to its rightful place in Argynvostholt may reignite the beacon of hope and grant powerful boons to those who oppose Strahd.
