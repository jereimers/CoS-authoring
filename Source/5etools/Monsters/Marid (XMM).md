## Traits

**Amphibious.** The marid can breathe air and water.

**Elemental Restoration.** If the marid dies outside the Elemental Plane of Water, its body dissolves into brine, and it gains a new body in `1d4` days, reviving with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] somewhere on the Plane of Water.

**Wishes.** The marid has a 30 percent chance of knowing the [[Wish|XPHB]] spell. If the marid knows it, the marid can cast it only on behalf of a non-genie creature who communicates a wish in a way the marid can understand. If the marid casts the spell for the creature, the marid suffers none of the spell's stress. Once the marid has cast it three times, the marid can't do so again for 365 days.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The marid makes three Aquatic Lash attacks.

**Aquatic Lash.** m +10, reach 15 ft. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) Slashing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) Cold damage.

**Water Jet.** dex DC 18, each creature in a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. @actSaveFail 31 (**9d6**) Cold damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is pushed up to 20 feet straight away from the marid and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
