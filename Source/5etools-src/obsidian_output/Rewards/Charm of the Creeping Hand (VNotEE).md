# Charm of the Creeping Hand

*Charm*

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an unarmed strike, you can infuse your strike with life-stealing energy. Your attack then deals an extra **1d10** necrotic damage, and you gain 5 [[temporary hit points|PHB]]. Once used five times, the charm vanishes.
