## Traits

**Limited Amphibiousness.** The sea spawn can breathe air and water, but needs to be submerged in the sea at least once a day for 1 minute to avoid suffocating.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sea spawn makes three attacks: two unarmed strikes and one with its Piscine Anatomy.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Piscine Anatomy.** The sea spawn has one or more of the following attack options, provided it has the appropriate anatomy:

- **Bite:** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.
- **Poison Quills:** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h3 (**1d6**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Tentacle:** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 12) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the sea spawn can't use this tentacle on another target.
