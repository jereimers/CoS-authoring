**Range:** 10 feet

You summon a special homunculus in an unoccupied space within range. This creature uses the [[Homunculus Servant|EFA]] stat block. If you already have a homunculus from this spell, the homunculus is replaced by the new one. You determine the homunculus's appearance, such as a mechanical-looking bird, winged vial, or miniature animate cauldron.

## Combat

The homunculus is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[Dodge|XPHB]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
