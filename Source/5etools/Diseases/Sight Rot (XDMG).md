# Sight Rot

Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted by Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition until the contagion ends.

### Fighting the Contagion

Magic such as a [[Heal|XPHB]] or [[Lesser Restoration|XPHB]] spell ends the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an [[Herbalism Kit|XPHB]] can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on the creature.

### Spreading the Contagion

Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours.
