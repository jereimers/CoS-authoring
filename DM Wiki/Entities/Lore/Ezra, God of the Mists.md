%% Lore is a bit of history, common knowledge, or confirmed rumor known to be true by in-game entities. It doesn't have to be universally true in order to be considered Lore -- the "redheaded Barovian women bring ill luck" piece of lore isn't literally true, but many in-world NPCs believe it to be true, so it is legitimate Lore. 

Lore is known by people and possibly shared at a particular time/place to various recipients. %%

The denizens of several domains worship an aloof god known as Ezra. Depicted as a vague, vaporous figure, the god is known for her dark, billowing hair and for her ability to manipulate the Mists. Her holy symbol is a sprig of belladonna atop a silver kite shield. Beyond that, her disparate sects of worshipers view her differently—and contradictorily. For some, Ezra is a goodly guardian, while others perceive her as a soul-stealing embodiment of the Mists. Ultimately, though, her true nature is a mystery. Whether she’s a manifestation of the Dark Powers, an aspect of the Plane of Shadow’s mysterious Raven Queen, or something else entirely is for you to decide. Whatever the case, Ezra’s followers, traditions, alignment, and the domains she grants her clerics vary widely. Collaborate with players who want to create characters devoted to Ezra to define the god’s role in their domain of origin.
