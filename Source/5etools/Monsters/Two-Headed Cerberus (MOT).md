## Traits

**Aggressive.** As a bonus action, the cerberus can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

**Multiheaded.** The cerberus can't be [[surprised]], and it has advantage on saving throws against being knocked [[unconscious]].

**Pack Tactics.** The cerberus has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the cerberus's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cerberus makes two bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage plus 2 (**1d4**) fire damage.

**Breath Weapon {@recharge 5}.** The cerberus exhales a 15-foot cone of molten rock. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also [[restrained]] by the hardening rock. A creature can make a DC 12 Strength ([[Athletics]]) check as an action, freeing itself or a creature within reach from the rock on a success. The rock has AC 17 and 10 hit points, and it is immune to fire, poison, and psychic damage.
