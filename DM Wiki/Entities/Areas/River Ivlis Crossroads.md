Check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area F, unless they are accompanied by Vistani.

An old wooden gallows creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam. The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: Barovia Village to the east, Tser Pool to the northwest, and Ravenloft/Vallaki to the

southwest. The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog.

The northwest fork leads down to the river and area G. The road southwest leads to area H. The east road leads to an arching stone bridge and continues on to the village of Barovia (area E). If the characters are traveling with Vistani, the Vistani lead them along the northwest road to the Vistani encampment.

The gallows stand atop a rotting platform 5 feet high, with wooden stairs leading up to it.
Eleven graves are here with blank gravestones. The forgotten people buried here were hanged from the gallows. Characters who dig up the graves find rotted coffins containing moldy bones.

# The Hanged One 

As the characters leave the area, read:

You hear a creaking noise behind you, coming from the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, gray body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly, so that it can fix its dead eyes upon you.

One random character sees him- or herself hanging from the gallows. The other characters see an unfamiliar Barovian. The corpse looks and smells real, and it rapidly melts away into nothing if touched or moved.

# Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried in one of the graves. For each grave the characters dig up, there's a cumulative 10 percent chance of finding the treasure.
