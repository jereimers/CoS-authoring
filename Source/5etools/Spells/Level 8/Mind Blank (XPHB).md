# Mind Blank

*8th-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 24 hours

---

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Psychic damage and the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even [[Wish|XPHB]]—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.
