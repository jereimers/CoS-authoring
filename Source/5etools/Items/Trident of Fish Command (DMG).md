# Trident of Fish Command

*Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

This trident is a magic weapon. It has 3 charges. While you carry it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast [[dominate beast]] (save DC 15) from it on a beast that has an innate swimming speed. The trident regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
