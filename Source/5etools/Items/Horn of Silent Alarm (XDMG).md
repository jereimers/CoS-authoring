# Horn of Silent Alarm

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This horn has 4 charges and regains `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn. As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can blow the horn while expending 1 charge. One creature of your choice hears the horn's blare, provided that creature is within 600 feet of the horn. No other creature hears the horn.
