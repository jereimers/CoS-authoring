## Traits

**Angelic Weapons.** The archon's weapon attacks are magical. When the archon hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra **3d8** radiant damage (included in the attack).

**Axiomatic Mind.** The archon can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its understanding of justice.

**Magic Resistance.** The archon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**One Being.** Though it appears as a humanoid creature riding a mount, an archon is a single being. The "rider" can't be dismounted, and no other means can separate the two portions of the archon's being short of its death.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The archon makes two attacks: one with its sword and one with its claws.

**Sword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) radiant damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) radiant damage.
