## Traits

**Immobilizing Fear.** When a creature that isn't a demon starts its turn within 30 feet of one or more rutterkins, that creature must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. The creature has disadvantage on the save if it's within 30 feet of six or more rutterkins. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[frightened]] of the rutterkins for 1 minute. While [[frightened]] in this way, the creature is [[restrained]]. At the end of each of the [[frightened]] creature's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the Crippling Fear of all rutterkins for 24 hours.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**3d6 + 2**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [[poisoned]]. At the end of each long rest, the [[poisoned]] target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points while [[poisoned]] in this way, it dies and instantly transforms into a living [[manes]]. The transformation can be undone only by a [[wish]] spell.
