# Who They Are

Kasimir Velikov is the leader and foremost scholar of the [[Dusk Elves]], the last remnants of an elven people who suffered a terrible tragedy over four centuries ago. He lives in a simple hovel below the [[Vistani Camp]] outside [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], surrounded by books and the weight of his people's history.

Kasimir is a mage of considerable knowledge, well-versed in arcane lore and ancient history. He bears visible scars on his face—remnants of the massacre that claimed the lives of all female dusk elves, including members of his own family. Despite centuries of grief and guilt, he remains committed to helping others and preserving what remains of his people's legacy.

# What the Party Knows

## First Meeting

- The party met Kasimir at his hovel below the [[Vistani Camp]]
- He lives alone, surrounded by books, scrolls, and the accumulated knowledge of his people
- He welcomed them with tea and hospitality despite the melancholy that haunts him
- Kasimir helped identify the magical schools (necromancy and evocation) in [[Khazan]]'s sigil on the platinum ring found at the [[Luna River]] crime scene

## Kasimir's Tale: The Tragedy of the Dusk Elves

Kasimir shared the devastating history of his people:

### The Ancient Past (Over 400 Years Ago)

- The [[Dusk Elves]] once lived in [[Barovia]] as a proud and prosperous people
- They possessed great knowledge of magic and arcane lore

### Patrina and Strahd

- Patrina became obsessed with [[Source/CoS-Reloaded/Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]] and his dark powers
- She offered herself to Strahd as his bride, hoping to share in his immortality
- Strahd accepted Patrina's offer, intending to make her his vampiric consort
- The dusk elves feared this union would doom their entire people to darkness

### The Stoning

- To prevent the unholy wedding, the dusk elves decided Patrina must die
- In a desperate act, they stoned Patrina to death
- **Kasimir himself threw the first stone**, though it tore his heart to do so
- The dusk elves believed they were saving their people from corruption

### Strahd's Revenge

- Strahd was enraged by Patrina's murder
- In retaliation, he ordered the deaths of all female dusk elves
- Strahd's forces slaughtered every woman and girl among the dusk elves
- Kasimir bears scars on his face from trying to protect the female members of his family during the massacre
- The dusk elves have been unable to have children ever since, condemning them to slow extinction

## His Current Situation

- Kasimir leads what remains of the [[Dusk Elves]]—a dying people, all male, aging toward extinction
- He serves as their scholar and keeper of their history
- He lives peacefully alongside the [[Vistani]], who respect his plight
- Despite his tragedy, he continues to help others, like joining the search for [[Arabelle]]
- He possesses extensive knowledge of arcane matters and local history

## Connection to Recent Events

- [[Savid]], a dusk elf scout, found [[Yan]]'s body at the [[Luna River]] crime scene
- The dusk elves joined the Vistani in searching for Arabelle, with nearly as many dusk elf scouts participating
- Kasimir examined the platinum ring found at the crime scene and identified the magical schools represented in its sigil
- He provided the party with information and hospitality

## The Broken Blade

During tea with Kasimir, [[Arden Nalero|Arden]] revealed the [[Broken Blade]]—a weapon bearing the lion sigil of [[Erevan Löwenhart]], Kasimir's uncle and the former dusk elf prince. The blade, impossibly preserved after centuries, represented a connection to Kasimir's lost family and people.

When Arden revealed the blade, life blazed in Kasimir's hollow eyes for the first time since the party met him. He embraced Arden as kin, and together they swore an oath: the blade would taste vengeance. [[Rahadin]] (Strahd's chamberlain and Kasimir's cousin) and Strahd himself would answer for their crimes against the dusk elves.

# Personality

- **Melancholic but Dignified**: Carries the weight of centuries of grief with quiet dignity
- **Scholarly and Precise**: Speaks with careful precision, measuring his words; possesses extensive knowledge of arcane matters and history
- **Helpful Despite His Pain**: Continues to assist others even while bearing his own immense burden
- **Haunted by Guilt**: The act of throwing the first stone at his sister clearly weighs heavily on him
- **Capable of Hope**: When presented with the Broken Blade, a spark of life and purpose returned to his eyes—suggesting he hasn't entirely given up
- **Honorable**: Willing to swear oaths and commit to causes he believes in
- **Measured and Controlled**: Maintains composure even when discussing the most painful parts of his history

# Where We've Seen Them

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Tea with Kasimir|Session 13]] — Met at his hovel below the Vistani Camp; shared the tragic history of the dusk elves; swore an oath of vengeance alongside Arden

### Vocal Notes


### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Kasimir is a quiet and withdrawn scholar, with a powerful curiosity and a fierce dedication to his people. To those he trusts, Kasimir is a lost and broken man, guilt-ridden for his role in Patrina’s death and resigned to somber despair for the dusk elves’ future. Only Kasimir knows the lengths to which he is willing to go to resurrect his sister—and the price he is willing to pay.

### Morale
In a fight, Kasimir would attempt to negotiate a peace, but would not hesitate to unleash his most powerful spells—or use his magic to escape—if a diplomatic solution proved untenable.

### Relationships
Kasimir is the leader of the dusk elf encampment and the younger brother of the late Patrina Velikovna, a **banshee** who resides in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft. Kasimir is also the cousin of [[Rahadin]], Strahd’s chamberlain, and the nephew of the late dusk elf prince, Erevan Löwenhart. (Kasimir is not a direct blood relation of Erevan, who married Kasimir’s aunt, Lorelei.)
