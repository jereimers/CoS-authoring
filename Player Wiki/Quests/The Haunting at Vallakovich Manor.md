# Objective

Investigate the haunting *discreetly*.

# What the Party knows

- For the past two months, a spirit has haunted the Vallakovich mansion. 
* Servants have seen its reflection in mirrors or darkened windows, and have reported cold drafts, strange sounds, and objects that move of their own volition.
* The mansion’s butler and the baroness' lady-in-waiting have already left [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]]'s employment, too fearful of the ghost to continue working in the house.
* [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]’s wife, Baroness Lydia Petrovna, hosts daily lunches for a group of Vallakian women, who [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] uses to prepare costumes and decorations for his weekly festivals. [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] is desperate to ensure that the women remain ignorant of the spirit’s existence.
* [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s cook, a doughty woman named Tereska, has seen the spirit most recently, and nearly quit her job before [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] convinced her to stay by (reluctantly) increasing her pay.
