## Traits

**Cunning Action.** On each of its turns, the thief can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Evasion.** If the thief is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the thief instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** The thief deals an extra 14 (**4d6**) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the thief that isn't [[incapacitated]] and the thief doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The thief makes three attacks with its shortsword.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** The thief halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The thief must be able to see the attacker.
