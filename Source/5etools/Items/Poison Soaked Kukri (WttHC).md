# Poison Soaked Kukri

*Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

You can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to magically coat the blade of this Dagger with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take **2d8** Poison damage and have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. This [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] can't be used again this way until the next dawn.
