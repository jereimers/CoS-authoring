## Traits

**Air Form.** The elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Whirlwind {@recharge 4}.** Each creature in the elemental's space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (**3d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked [[prone]]. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [[prone]].

If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked [[prone]].
