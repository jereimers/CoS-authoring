## Traits

**Ruinous Acid.** Any nonmagical weapon that hits the spider corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the spider is destroyed after dealing damage.

**Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spider makes two Ruinous Bite attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Web.

**Ruinous Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage and 9 (**2d8**) acid damage. In addition, if the target is a creature wearing nonmagical armor, the armor takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an Armor Class of 10 is destroyed.

**Web {@recharge 5}.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. @hThe target has the [[restrained]] condition. As an action, a [[restrained]] target can make a DC 13 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a successful check. The webbing can also be destroyed (AC 10; 5 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to acid, bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
