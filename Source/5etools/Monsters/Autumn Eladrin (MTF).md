## Traits

**Enchanting Presence.** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[charmed]] by the eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Enchanting Presence for 24 hours.

Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [[charmed]] creature, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Fey Step {@recharge 4}.** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Magic Resistance.** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 1**) slashing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) psychic damage, or 6 (**1d10 + 1**) slashing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) psychic damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) psychic damage.



## Reactions

**Foster Peace.** If a creature [[charmed]] by the eladrin hits with an attack roll while within 60 feet of the eladrin, the eladrin magically causes the attack to miss, provided the eladrin can see the attacker.
