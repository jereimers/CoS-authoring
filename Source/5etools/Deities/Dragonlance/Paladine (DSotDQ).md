# Paladine

**Pantheon:** Dragonlance  
**Alignment:** Lawful Good  
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** Silver triangle

Paladine is known as the Father of Good, the Master of Law, the Platinum Dragon, and—on other worlds of the multiverse—Bahamut. He leads the gods of good and watches over the world with an eye toward order, justice, and mercy. He teaches that wise and just laws are the basis of a functioning society, and his clerics often aid in crafting and upholding such laws. Paladine sometimes appears on Krynn in the guise of Fizban, a befuddled old human mage in faded robes.
