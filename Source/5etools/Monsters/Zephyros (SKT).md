## Traits

**Keen Smell.** Zephyros has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.


## Actions

**Fling.** Zephyros tries to throw a Small or Medium creature within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 60 feet horizontally in a direction of Zephyros's choice and land [[prone]], taking **1d8** bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.

**Wind Aura.** A magical aura of wind surrounds Zephyros. The aura is a 10-foot-radius sphere that lasts as long as he maintains [[concentration]] on it (as if [[concentration]] on a spell). While the aura is in effect, Zephyros gains a +2 bonus to his AC against ranged weapon attacks, and all open flames within the aura are extinguished unless they are magical.

**Multiattack.** Zephyros makes two staff attacks.

**Staff of the Magi.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d6 + 10**) bludgeoning damage, or 23 (**3d8 + 10**) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands. This damage is considered magical..

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h30 (**4d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.
