## Traits

**Sun Sickness.** While in sunlight, the myconid has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on [[D20 Test|XPHB]]. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in sunlight.


## Actions

**Animating Spores (3/Day).** The myconid releases spores at a Medium or Small corpse within 5 feet of it that wasn't a Construct or an Undead. In 24 hours, the corpse rises as a [[Myconid Spore Servant|XMM]]. The corpse stays animate for `1d4 + 1` weeks or until destroyed, and it can't be animated again in this way.

**Pacifying Spores.** con DC 12, one creature the myconid can see within 10 feet. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Stunned|XPHB]] condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
