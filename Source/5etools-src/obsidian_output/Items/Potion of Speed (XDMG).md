# Potion of Speed

*Item, Very Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[Haste|XPHB]] spell for 1 minute (no [[Concentration]] required) without suffering the wave of lethargy that typically occurs when the effect ends.

This potion's yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.
