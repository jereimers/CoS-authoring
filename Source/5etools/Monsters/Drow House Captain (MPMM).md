## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drow makes two Scimitar attacks and one Whip or Hand Crossbow attack.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) slashing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) poison damage.

**Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Hand Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [[unconscious]] while [[poisoned]] in this way. The target regains consciousness if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it.


## Bonus Actions

**Battle Command.** Choose one creature within 30 feet of the drow that the drow can see. If the chosen creature can see or hear the drow, that creature can use its reaction to make one melee attack or to take the [[Dodge]] or [[Hide]] action.


## Reactions

**Parry.** The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack roll that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
