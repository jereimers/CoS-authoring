# Spike Growth

*2nd-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes **2d4** piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
