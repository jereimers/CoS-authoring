## Traits

**Formed by the Mists.** When created, the horror's body composition takes one of four forms: Aberrant Armor, Loathsome Limbs, Malleable Mass, or Oozing Organs. This form determines certain traits in this stat block.

**Amorphous (Malleable Mass Only).** The horror can move through any opening at least 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Bile Body (Oozing Organs Only).** Any creature that touches the horror or hits it with a melee attack takes 5 (**1d10**) acid damage.

**Relentless Stride (Loathsome Limbs Only).** The horror can move through the space of another creature. The first time on a turn that the horror enters a creature's space during this move, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The horror makes two Limbs attacks.

**Limbs.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Hex Blast {@recharge 5}.** The horror expels necrotic energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (**7d12**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
