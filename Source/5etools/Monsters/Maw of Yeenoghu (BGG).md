## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The maw has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The maw makes two Bite or Fang Fling attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d12 + 6**) piercing damage.

**Fang Fling.** Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d10 + 6**) piercing damage.

**Gorging Charge {@recharge 5}.** The maw moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and can move through the spaces of Large or smaller creatures. Each time the maw enters a creature's space for the first time during this move, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or take 25 (**3d12 + 6**) piercing damage and have the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16); if a creature is already [[grappled]] this way, it has the [[prone]] condition. Until this grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition. The maw can have only one creature [[grappled]] in this way at a time.



## Reactions

**Fanged Rebuke.** In response to taking damage, the maw makes one Bite attack against a random creature within 10 feet of itself. If no creature is within reach, the maw can make two Fang Fling attacks.
