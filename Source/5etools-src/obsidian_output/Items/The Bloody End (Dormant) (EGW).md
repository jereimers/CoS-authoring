# The Bloody End (Dormant)

*Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement)*

Carrying the power of Bane, this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.

## Sentience

The Bloody End is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.

## Personality

A tyrannical [[pit fiend]] named Izeelzee lives within The Bloody End. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.

## Dormant

The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Infernal.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 13): [[charm person]], [[dominate person]], or [[fear]]. Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
- While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma ([[Intimidation]]) checks.

> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property and one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property and an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.
