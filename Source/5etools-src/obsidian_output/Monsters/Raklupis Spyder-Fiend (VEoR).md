## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The raklupis has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The raklupis can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** When in contact with a web, the raklupis knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The raklupis ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The raklupis makes a Bite attack and two Serrated Sword attacks. It can use Venom Globe in place of one of these attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, a creature has the [[incapacitated]] condition and can't regain hit points. A [[poisoned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Serrated Sword.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h19 (**4d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) poison damage.

**Venom Globe.** Ranged Weapon Attack +11 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. @h45 (**10d8**) poison damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Demand Loyalty.** The raklupis magically ends the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions on itself and on any number of allies within 60 feet of itself.
