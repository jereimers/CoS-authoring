## Traits

**Aberrant Mind.** Magic can't read the psurlon's thoughts or put the psurlon to sleep.

**Two Heads.** The psurlon has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid or end the [[frightened]], [[stunned]], or [[unconscious]] condition on itself. While one of the psurlon's heads is asleep, its other head is awake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The psurlon makes two Bite attacks and two Claw attacks. It can also use Pacify (if available) or Psychic Crush.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Pacify {@recharge 5}.** The psurlon targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall [[unconscious]] for 10 minutes. The condition ends if the target takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the target awake.

**Psychic Crush.** The psurlon targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 21 (**3d10 + 5**) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
