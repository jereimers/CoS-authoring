# Greater Mark of Warding

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Improved Intuition

When you use the Warder's Intuition benefit of your [[Mark of Warding|EFA]] feat, you can roll `1d6` instead of `1d4`.

## Improved Warding

When a creature makes an attack roll against you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to impose [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on that roll. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
