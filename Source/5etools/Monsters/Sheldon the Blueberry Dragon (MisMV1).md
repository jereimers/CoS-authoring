## Traits

**Space Dweller.** Sheldon can breathe normally in a vacuum.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Sheldon makes either two Bite attacks, two Blueberry Fling attacks, or one of each.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) psychic damage.

**Blueberry Fling.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) blueberry damage.

**Jetstream Breath {@recharge 5}.** Sheldon exhales a line of magical wind that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (**6d6**) force damage, is pushed 15 feet away from Sheldon, and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.


## Bonus Actions

**Wind Dash (2/Day).** Sheldon summons a powerful gust of wind and flies up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. At the end of this movement, each creature within 5 feet of Sheldon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition, as the wind bursts around Sheldon.
