# Everbright Lantern

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This bullseye lantern contains an Eberron dragonshard that sheds light comparable to that produced by a [[continual flame]] spell. An everbright lantern sheds light in a 120-foot cone; the closest 60 feet is bright light, and the farthest 60 feet is dim light.
