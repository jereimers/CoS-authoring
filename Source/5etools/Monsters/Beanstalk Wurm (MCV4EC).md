## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the wurm is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the wurm move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the wurm is animate.

**Leafy Handholds.** Creatures have advantage on ability checks made to climb the wurm.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the wurm fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Regeneration.** The wurm regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the wurm takes fire or lightning damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the wurm's next turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wurm makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h30 (**5d8 + 8**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the wurm. A swallowed creature has the [[restrained]] condition, has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the wurm, and takes 28 (**8d6**) piercing damage at the start of each of the wurm's turns from thorns in the wurm's gullet.

The wurm's stomach can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the wurm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the wurm must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the wurm and has the [[prone]] condition. If the wurm dies, a swallowed creature no longer has the [[restrained]] condition and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting with the [[prone]] condition.
