## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The emissary has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The emissary makes three talons attacks.

**Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Alluring Thrum {@recharge 5}.** The emissary emits a dreadful yet alluring hum. Each creature within 20 feet of the emissary that can hear it and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[charmed]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Crystal Spores {@recharge}.** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic crystalline spores extends out from the emissary. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]]. While [[poisoned]] in this way, a creature takes 11 (**2d10**) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
