Protective magical frost surrounds you. You gain 5 [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]]. If a creature hits you with a melee attack roll before the spell ends, the creature takes 5 Cold damage. The spell ends early if you have no [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]].

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] and the Cold damage both increase by 5 for each spell slot level above 1.
