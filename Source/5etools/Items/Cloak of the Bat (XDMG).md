# Cloak of the Bat

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Dexterity ([[Stealth|XPHB]]) checks. In an area of [[Dim Light|XPHB]] or [[Darkness|XPHB]], you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in [[Dim Light|XPHB]] or [[Darkness|XPHB]], you lose this [[Fly Speed|XPHB]].

While wearing the cloak in an area of [[Dim Light|XPHB]] or [[Darkness|XPHB]], you can cast [[Polymorph|XPHB]] on yourself, shape-shifting into a [[Bat|XMM]]. While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
