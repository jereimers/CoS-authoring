# Investment of the Chain Master

When you cast [[Find Familiar|XPHB]], you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits.

### Aerial or Aquatic

The familiar gains either a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] or a [[Swim Speed|XPHB]] (your choice) of 40 feet.

### Quick Attack

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can command the familiar to take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action.

### Necrotic or Radiant Damage

Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

### Your Save DC

If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.

### Resistance

When the familiar takes damage, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to grant it [[Resistance|XPHB]] against that damage.
