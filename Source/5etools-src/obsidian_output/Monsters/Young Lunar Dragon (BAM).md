## Traits

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

**Unusual Nature.** The dragon doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) cold damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Cold Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a blast of frost in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (**6d8**) cold damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced.


## Bonus Actions

**Phase (2/Day).** The dragon becomes partially incorporeal for as long as it maintains [[concentration]] on the effect (as if [[concentration]] on a spell). While partially incorporeal, the dragon has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
