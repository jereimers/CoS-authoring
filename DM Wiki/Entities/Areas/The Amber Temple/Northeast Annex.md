# X10. Northeast Annex

The walls and ceiling in the eastern portion of this bare stone room have collapsed. To the west and south are open amber doors. In the center of the room is a ten-foot-tall statue of a jackal-headed warrior made of cracked amber. It turns to face you and clenches its fists.

The ceiling here is 20 feet high, and the walls are lined with empty torch sconces. The statue is a damaged amber golem (use the stat block for the stone golem in the Monster Manual). It has 145 hit points and attacks any creature it sees, stopping only when it can't see any.

An earthquake collapsed the eastern part of the room long ago.
