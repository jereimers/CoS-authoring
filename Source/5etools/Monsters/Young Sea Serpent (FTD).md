## Traits

**Amphibious.** The sea serpent can breathe air and water.

**Siege Monster.** The sea serpent deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sea serpent makes one Bite attack and one Constrict or Tail attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) cold damage.

**Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. @h22 (**4d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the sea serpent can't constrict another target.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked [[prone]].

**Rime Breath {@recharge 5}.** The sea serpent exhales a 30-foot cone of cold. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 38 (**7d10**) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
