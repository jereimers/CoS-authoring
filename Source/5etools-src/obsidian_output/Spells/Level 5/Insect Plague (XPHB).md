# Insect Plague

*5th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 300 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a locust)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point you choose within range. The [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] remains for the duration, and its area is [[Lightly Obscured|XPHB]] and [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]].

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **4d10** Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `4d10` for each spell slot level above 5.
