# Vampire's Plaything

You gain the following benefits.

## Decanting

When you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you can create one [[Potion of Healing|XDMG]] or an [[Antitoxin|XPHB]], as long as you have an empty [[vial|XPHB]] or [[flask|XPHB]]. These liquids evaporate when you finish another [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Timely Retreat

You can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to take the [[Dash|XPHB]] action or the [[Disengage|XPHB]] action. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you recover all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Vampiric Connection

The DM determines the fate of your former vampire master. While you and your former vampire master are on the same plane of existence, the vampire can communicate with you telepathically, and you can choose to allow the vampire to perceive through your senses.
