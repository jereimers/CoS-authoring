# Weird

*9th-level illusion*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes **10d10** Psychic damage and has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

A [[Frightened|XPHB]] target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes **5d10** Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.
