# Overview

Located close to the shores of [[Lake Zarovich]], the town of Vallaki (pronounced vah-lah-key) seems like a safe haven against the evils of the [[Svalich Woods]], if not Strahd himself. The town lies beyond the sight of [[Castle Ravenloft]] and doesn't, at first blush, seem as depressed (or oppressed) as the [[Village of Barovia]] farther east.

# Description

The [[Old Svalich Road]] meanders into a valley watched over by dark, brooding mountains to the north and south. The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber.

The dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them. Planted in the ground and flanking the road outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves' heads impaled on them.

A 15-foot-high wall encloses the town, its vertical logs held together with thick ropes and mortar. The top of each log has been sharpened to a point. Wooden scaffolding hugs the inside of the palisade twelve feet off the ground, enabling guards to peer over the wall there.

# What the party knows
- The burgomaster, [[Non-Player Characters#Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vargas Vallakovich]], has decreed that the [[05 - Vallaki - Festival of the Blazing Sun|Festival of the Blazing Sun]] will be held in the town square ([[Town Square]]) on Neyavr 7. The previous festival, which he called the Wolf's Head Jamboree, was less than a week ago.
- Vallaki has endured at least one festival every week for the past several years. Some Vallakians believe that the festivals keep the devil [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] at bay. Others think they provide no protection or benefit whatsoever. Most consider them dismal affairs.
- Those who speak ill of the festivals are declared by the burgomaster to be in league with the devil Strahd and arrested. Some are thrown in the stocks in the [[Town Square]], while others (like [[Willemina Rikalova|Willemina's]] son [[Udo Lukovich]])
- The burgomaster's henchman, [[Izek Strazni]], has a history of violence as well as a fiendish deformity: a monstrous arm with which he can conjure fire. Fear of lzek keeps [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the baron]]'s enemies at bay.
- There's a [[Vistani Camp]] in the woods southwest of town. Vistani aren't welcome in Vallaki.

# Notable places
- [[St. Andral's Church]] -- Refuge from the forces of darkness...?
- [[Blue Water Inn]] -- A good place to stay! Wolf steaks!
- [[Blinsky Toys]] -- *Is no fun, is no Blinsky!*
- [[Vistani Camp]] -- home of [[Arabelle]], the one for whom you promised [[Madam Eva]] you'd buy a nameday gift (see Quest: [[Arabelle's Gift]])
