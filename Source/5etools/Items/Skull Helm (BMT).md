# Skull Helm

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this skull-shaped helm, you have resistance to cold, poison, and necrotic damage.

Additionally, while wearing the helm, you can cast [[Spirit of Death|BMT]] from it without requiring material components. Once you use the helm to cast the spell, the helm can't cast this spell again until the next dawn.
