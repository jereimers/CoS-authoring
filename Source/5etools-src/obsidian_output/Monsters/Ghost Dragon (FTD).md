## Traits

**Incorporeal Movement.** The ghost dragon can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the ghost dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Unusual Nature.** The ghost dragon doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The ghost dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h32 (**6d8 + 5**) cold damage, and the target's speed is halved until the start of the dragon's next turn.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) necrotic damage.

**Terrifying Breath {@recharge}.** The ghost dragon exhales shadowy mist in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 40 (**9d8**) cold damage and is [[frightened]] of the ghost dragon for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[frightened]].

While [[frightened]] of the ghost dragon, a creature is [[paralyzed]]. The [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this ghost dragon's Terrifying Breath for the next 24 hours.
