## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The kruthik has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Pack Tactics.** The kruthik has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kruthik's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Tunneler.** The kruthik can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kruthik makes two stab attacks or two spike attacks.

**Stab.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Spike.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Acid Spray {@recharge 5}.** The kruthik sprays acid in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
