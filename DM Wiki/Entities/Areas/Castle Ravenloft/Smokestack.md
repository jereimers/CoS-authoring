# K52. Smokestack

Jutting from the steeply sloping rooftop of the castle, a spindly smokestack, five feet in diameter at the top, rises thirty feet above the roof's peak. Smoke belches from its iron-pronged capstone.

The chimney leads down 60 feet to the blazing fireplace in area K37. A creature that starts its turn in the chimney takes 3 (1d6) fire damage.
