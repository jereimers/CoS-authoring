# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a [[fire elemental]], as if you had cast the [[conjure elemental]] spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
