# Enclave Magic

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Friend to Animals

You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on ability checks when taking the [[Influence|XPHB]] action with Beasts.

## Two Hearts, One Mind

You always have the [[Beast Sense|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. When you cast it without a spell slot using this feature, it doesn't require [[Concentration]]. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spell's spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
