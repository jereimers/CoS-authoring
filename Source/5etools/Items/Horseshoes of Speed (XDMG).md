# Horseshoes of Speed

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a [[Magic|XPHB]] action.

While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its [[Speed|XPHB]] is increased by 30 feet.
