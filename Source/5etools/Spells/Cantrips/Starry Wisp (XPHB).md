# Starry Wisp

*Cantrip evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a mote of light at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **1d8** Radiant damage, and until the end of your next turn, it emits [[Dim Light|XPHB]] in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition.

## Cantrip Upgrade

The damage increases by **1d8** when you reach levels 5 (**2d8**), 11 (**3d8**), and 17 (**4d8**).
