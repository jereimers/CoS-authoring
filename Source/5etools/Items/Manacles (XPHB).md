# Manacles

*Item, None*

As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can use Manacles to bind an unwilling Small or Medium creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [[Grappled|XPHB]], [[Incapacitated|XPHB]], or [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity ([[Sleight of Hand|XPHB]]) check. While bound, a creature has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls, and the creature is [[Restrained|XPHB]] if the Manacles are attached to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the Manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([[Sleight of Hand|XPHB]]) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check as an action.

Each set of Manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use [[Thieves' Tools|XPHB]] to pick the Manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([[Sleight of Hand|XPHB]]) check.
