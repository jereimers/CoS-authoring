## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 (`1d6`) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.
