## Actions

**Multiattack.** The su-monster makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**2d4 + 2**) slashing damage, or 12 (**4d4 + 2**) slashing damage if the su-monster is hanging by its tail and all four of its limbs are free.

**Psychic Crush {@recharge 5}.** The su-monster targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 17 (**5d6**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. The [[stunned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
