# Lichen Plague

A Beast, Giant, Humanoid, or Monstrosity that comes into contact with bile lichen spores is at risk of contracting a horrible disease as the lichen takes root on its body and grows into its brain. A creature suffers the following effects `1d4` days after infection:

- **Skinroot:** The contagion first appears as a patch of green-yellow lichen no larger than 1 square inch on a random area of the body. When it finishes a Long Rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 Exhaustion level as the lichen spreads toward the creature's head. This Exhaustion level lasts until the contagion ends on the creature.
- **Mindroot:** A Humanoid that dies while infected with Lichen Plague rises immediately as a [[Zombie|XMM]] under the DM's control.

### Fighting the Contagion

When it finishes a Long Rest, an infected creature makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the creature succeeds on three of these saving throws, the contagion ends on the creature and the creature is immune to Lichen Plague forever. The successful saves don't need to be consecutive.

### Spreading the Contagion

Any Beast, Giant, Humanoid, or Monstrosity that makes skin contact with the lichen on an infected creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with Lichen Plague. On a successful save, the creature can't catch Lichen Plague for the next 24 hours.
