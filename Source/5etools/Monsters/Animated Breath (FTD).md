**Fire Aura (Fire Form Only).** At the start of each of the animated breath's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 3 (**1d6**) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the animated breath or hits it with a melee attack takes 3 (**1d6**) fire damage.

**Putrid Aura (Acid and Poison Forms Only).** A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the animated breath must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. A creature that touches the animated breath or hits it with a melee attack takes 3 (**1d6**) acid damage.
