# Vizier

- **Skill Proficiencies::** [[History]], [[Religion]]
- **Tool Proficiencies::** One type of artisan's tools, one type of musical instrument
- **Equipment::** A set of artisan's tools or a musical instrument (one of your choice), a scroll of your god's teachings, a vizier's cartouche, a set of [[fine clothes|phb]], and a [[pouch|phb]] containing 25 gp

## Feature: Voice of Authority

Your voice is the voice of your god, at least in theory. Your job might include training and instructing initiates, and they are required to obey you. In any circumstance, an initiate is expected to defer to your voice and obey your commands. If you abuse this authority, though, your god might personally punish you.

## Suggested Characteristics

A vizier's characteristics strongly reflect the ideals and personality of the god they serve.
