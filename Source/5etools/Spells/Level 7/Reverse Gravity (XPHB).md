This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects in that area that aren't anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall upward.

If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it just as they would during a downward fall. If an affected creature or object reaches the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]'s top without striking anything, it hovers there for the duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
