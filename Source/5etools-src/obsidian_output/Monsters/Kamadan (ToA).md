## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The kamadan has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Pounce.** If the kamadan moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is knocked [[prone]], the kamadan can make two attacks—one with its bite and one with its snakes—against it as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kamadan makes two attacks: one with its bite or claw and one with its snakes.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Snakes.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (**6d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Sleep Breath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The kamadan exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall [[unconscious]] for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if it takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
