## Traits

**Numbing Aura.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature can't make more than one attack, or take a bonus action on that turn.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is fire, radiant, or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The zombie makes two weapon attacks.

**Greataxe.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h25 (**3d12 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Hurl Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Freezing Stare.** The zombie targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 35 (**10d6**) cold damage and be [[paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn.
