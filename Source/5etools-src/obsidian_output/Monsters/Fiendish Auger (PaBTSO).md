## Traits

**Siege Monster.** The auger deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Tunneler.** The auger can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Flaming Drill.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) fire damage. If the auger moves at least 20 feet in a straight line toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an additional 11 (**2d10**) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.


## Bonus Actions

**Burst of Heat {@recharge 5}.** The auger releases an intense burst of heat in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. This heat spreads around corners. Each creature in this area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (**3d8**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
