## Traits

**Nimble Escape.** The goblin can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The goblin makes two attacks with its scimitar. The second attack has disadvantage.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d6**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Redirect Attack.** When a creature the goblin can see targets it with an attack, the goblin chooses another goblin within 5 feet of it. The two goblins swap places, and the chosen goblin becomes the target instead.
