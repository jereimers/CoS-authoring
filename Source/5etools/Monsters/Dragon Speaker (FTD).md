## Actions

**Multiattack.** The speaker makes two Thunder Bolt attacks.

**Thunder Bolt.** Attack (ms,rs) +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d8**) thunder damage, and the target is pushed horizontally up to 10 feet away from the speaker.



## Reactions

**Disarming Words (3/Day).** When a creature the speaker can see within 60 feet of it makes a damage roll, the speaker can roll a `d6` and subtract the number rolled from that damage roll.
