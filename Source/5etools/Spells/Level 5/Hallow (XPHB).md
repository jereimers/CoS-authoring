You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy or unholy power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area already under the effect of Hallow. The affected area has the following effects.

## Hallowed Ward

Choose any of these creature types: Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead. Creatures of the chosen types can't willingly enter the area, and any creature that is possessed by or that has the [[Charmed|XPHB]] or [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition from such creatures isn't possessed, [[Charmed|XPHB]], or [[Frightened|XPHB]] by them while in the area.

## Extra Effect

You bind an extra effect to the area from the list below:

- **Courage:** Creatures of any types you choose can't gain the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition while in the area.
- **Darkness:** [[Darkness|XPHB]] fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a level lower than this spell, can't illuminate the area.
- **Daylight:** Bright light fills the area. Magical [[Darkness|XPHB]] created by spells of a level lower than this spell can't extinguish the light.
- **Peaceful Rest:** [[Dead|XPHB]] bodies interred in the area can't be turned into Undead.
- **Extradimensional Interference:** Creatures of any types you choose can't enter or exit the area using teleportation or interplanar travel.
- **Fear:** Creatures of any types you choose have the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition while in the area.
- **Resistance:** Creatures of any types you choose have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to one damage type of your choice while in the area.
- **Silence:** No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.
- **Tongues:** Creatures of any types you choose can communicate with any other creature in the area even if they don't share a common language.
- **Vulnerability:** Creatures of any types you choose have [[Vulnerability|XPHB]] to one damage type of your choice while in the area.
