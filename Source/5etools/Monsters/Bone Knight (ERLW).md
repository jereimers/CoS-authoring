## Traits

**Commander of Bones.** As a bonus action, the knight can target one skeleton or zombie it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must obey the knight's commands until the knight dies or until the knight releases it as a bonus action. The knight can command up to twelve undead at a time this way.

**Master of the Pallid Banner.** While within 60 feet of the knight, any undead ally of the knight has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The knight attacks twice with one of its weapons.

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 1**) piercing damage.
