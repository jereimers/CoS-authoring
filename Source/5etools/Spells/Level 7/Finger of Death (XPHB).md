# Finger of Death

*7th-level necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You unleash negative energy toward a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **7d8 + 30** Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [[Zombie|XMM]] that follows your verbal orders.
