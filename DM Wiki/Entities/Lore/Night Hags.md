# What They Are

Night hags are powerful fiendish creatures that prey on mortals by invading their dreams and feeding on their fear and despair. They are cunning, ancient, and wield dark magic.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Victor Vallakovich]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

- Night hags can travel between the material world and the [[Ethereal Plane]]
- They prey on sleeping victims, causing nightmares and draining their life force
- A night hag possesses a [[Heartstone|heartstone]]—a magical gemstone that serves as their life force and connection to the Ethereal Plane
- [[Erasmus|Erasmus]] has observed a night hag haunting the [[Refugee Camp]] outside [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]
- The party suspects this night hag is [[Morgantha]], the old woman who sells [[Dream Pastry|dream pastries]] to desperate refugees
- The refugees at the camp have been reporting nightmares, fatigue, and people waking up screaming—classic signs of hag predation
- The party needs a night hag's heartstone to perform the ritual that will allow them to enter the Ethereal Plane and rescue [[Stella Wachter]]'s soul

# Appearance

Based on Erasmus's observations (as relayed by Victor):

- Gaunt female figure
- Sallow, gray-blue skin

# Appearance in Sessions
