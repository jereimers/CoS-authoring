## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The chaos quadrapod has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The chaos quadrapod makes up to two tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]]. The chaos quadrapod can grapple no more than two targets at a time.

**Chaos Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The chaos quadrapod shoots forth a knot of roiling ethereal light that explodes at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn.
