## Traits

**Rally the Troops.** As a bonus action, the githyanki can magically end the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions on itself and each creature of its choice that it can see within 30 feet of it.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The githyanki makes three greatsword attacks.

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage plus 17 (**5d6**) psychic damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** The githyanki adds 4 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the githyanki must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
