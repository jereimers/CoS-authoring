# Luvash Profile

## Portrait
![[05-011.luvash.png]]

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Luvash should make the players feel sympathetic to his grief, endeared to his dedication to his daughter, irritated with his stubbornness, and mildly uncomfortable with his hot temper.

### Emotions
Luvash most often feels angered, melancholy, anxious, guilty, desperate, frustrated, joyful, content, amused, or grateful.

### Motivations
Luvash wants to ensure that his daughter, [[Arabelle]], is safe and loved, and that the families of the Vistani encampment can thrive and prosper.

### Inspirations

## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Luvash is a gruff, stubborn brawler with an impatient spirit and a heart of gold. To those he trusts, Luvash is a fiercely devoted father with a soft and gentle compassion—but near-overwhelmed by anxiety for the safety of his daughter.

### Morale
In a fight, Luvash would draw his blade to protect his people without a moment’s hesitation, but would swiftly sheathe it if necessary to keep [[Arabelle]] safe.

### Relationships
Luvash is the elder brother of Arrigal, one of Strahd’s spies. (Luvash doesn’t know that Arrigal is a spy for Strahd.) Luvash is also the father of [[Arabelle]], whose mother was one of Madam Eva’s descendants, and—along with Arrigal—one of the two leaders of the Vistani camp outside of Vallaki.
