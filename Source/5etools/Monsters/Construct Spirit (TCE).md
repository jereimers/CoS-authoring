## Traits

**Heated Body (Metal Only).** A creature that touches the construct or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes **1d10** fire damage.

**Stony Lethargy (Stone Only).** When a creature the construct can see starts its turn within 10 feet of the construct, the construct can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target can't use reactions and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The construct makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack @hitYourSpellAttack to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h**1d8 + 4 + summonSpellLevel** bludgeoning damage.



## Reactions

**Berserk Lashing (Clay Only).** When the construct takes damage, it makes a slam attack against a random creature within 5 feet of it. If no creature is within reach, the construct moves up to half its speed toward an enemy it can see, without provoking opportunity attacks.
