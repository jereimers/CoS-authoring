## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** The clawfoot has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the clawfoot's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Pounce.** If the clawfoot moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is [[prone]], the clawfoot can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The clawfoot makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) slashing damage.
