## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If the beast fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Siege Monster.** The beast deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The beast makes two Claw attacks and one Tusk attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h14 (**1d12 + 8**) slashing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Tusk.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d8 + 8**) slashing damage.

**Disintegration Gaze {@recharge 5}.** The beast targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 70 (**10d6 + 40**) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this magical effect reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is disintegrated and leaves nothing behind, except a pile of ashes plus whatever equipment it was wearing or carrying.


## Bonus Actions

**Teleport (2/Day).** The beast magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Tusk Attack.** The beast makes one Tusk attack.

**Charge (Costs 2 Actions).** The beast moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks, then makes two Tusk attacks.

**Frightful Howl (Costs 2 Actions).** The beast howls as it exhales a cloud of magical fear gas in a 120-foot cone. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the beast for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
