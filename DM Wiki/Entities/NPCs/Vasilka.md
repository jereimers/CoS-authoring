# Vasilka Profile

## Portrait
*No portrait available.*

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Vasilka should inspire endearment for her clumsy sweetness, occasionally awkward naivete, overpowering innocence, insatiable love of learning, and ability to find a silver lining to every cloud; sympathy for her anxiety and fear of angering the Abbot; and flattery for her genuine and rapt fascination with the players and their heroic adventures.

### Emotions
Vasilka most often feels curious, joyful, thoughtful, shy, anxious, hopeful, and dreamy.

### Motivations
Vasilka wants to make the Abbot happy, befriend her **flesh golem** "brother," and learn as much as she can about people and the world.

### Inspirations
When playing Vasilka, channel Newt Scamander (*Fantastic Beasts*), Hinata Hyuuga (*Naruto*), and Alice (*Alice in Wonderland*).

### Vocal Notes


### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Vasilka is a polite, withdrawn, and well-mannered maiden. To those she trusts, she is a shy, occasionally anxious, and desperately curious spirit.

### Morale
At the time the players meet her, Vasilka would cower and plead for peace if attacked, not fighting even to defend herself.

### Relationships
Vasilka is the Abbot's creation and the "younger sister" of the Abbey's mindless **flesh golem**.
