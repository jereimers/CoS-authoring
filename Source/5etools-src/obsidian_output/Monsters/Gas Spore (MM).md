## Traits

**Death Burst.** The gas spore explodes when it drops to 0 hit points. Each creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) poison damage and become infected with a disease on a failed save. Creatures immune to the [[poisoned]] condition are immune to this disease.

Spores invade an infected creature's system, killing the creature in a number of hours equal to `1d12` + the creature's Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. In half that time, the creature becomes [[poisoned]] for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it sprouts `2d4` Tiny gas spores that grow to full size in 7 days.

**Eerie Resemblance.** The gas spore resembles a beholder. A creature that can see the gas spore can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([[Nature]]) check.


## Actions

**Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack +0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h1 poison damage, and the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the disease described in the Death Burst trait.
