# Berronar Truesilver

**Pantheon:** Dwarven  
**Alignment:** Lawful Good  
**Domains:** Life, Light, Peace  
**Symbol:** Intertwined silver rings

The Matron of Home and Hearth is the patron of family, honor, and law. She lays out the rules for managing a dwarf clan.

Berronar's code establishes the laws of the dwarves, including contracts, trade agreements, and every other kind of bond forged through words and deeds. As Moradin provides the example that dwarves strive to match, Berronar provides the bonds that create dwarven society and culture.

Berronar's priests arrange marriages, using a process that finds the best matches and is designed to ensure that each generation of a clan is stronger and more talented than the last. Their dictates in this respect are sacrosanct, and a dwarf designated for an arranged marriage must obey the priests or risk exile.
