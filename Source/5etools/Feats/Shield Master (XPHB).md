# Shield Master

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Shield Bash

If you attack a creature within 5 feet of you as part of the [[Attack|XPHB]] action and hit with a Melee weapon, you can immediately bash the target with your [[Shield|XPHB]] if it's equipped, forcing the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]). On a failed save, you either push the target 5 feet from you or cause it to have the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition (your choice). You can use this benefit only once on each of your turns.

## Interpose Shield

If you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and are holding a [[Shield|XPHB]].
