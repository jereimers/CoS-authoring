# Ezmerelda's Silvered Shortsword

## Description
A **silvered shortsword** wielded by [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]], the Vistana vampire hunter. This weapon has been coated or alloyed with silver, making it particularly effective against creatures with resistance or immunity to nonmagical, non-silvered weapons—such as werewolves and certain other monsters.

As a dedicated monster hunter, Ezmerelda understands the importance of carrying silvered weapons when facing lycanthropes and other creatures vulnerable to silver.
