# K50. Guest Room

A large bed sits in the center of this room, its four corner posts supporting a black canopy trimmed with gold tassels. Several comfortable divans are placed about the room. There is a banded door in the west wall and a smaller unbanded door in the east wall.

There is no danger in this area during the day. But if the characters try to take a short rest here during the night, the rest is interrupted by the arrival of 1d4 Barovian witches from area K56. They try to subdue the party with sleep spells. A witch retreats to area K56 if wounded.
