### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Ismark is a courageous, reliable, and compassionate leader. To those he trusts, Ismark is a self-doubting, struggling warrior desperate to keep his loved ones safe. Deep down, Ismark worries that he will never live up to his ancestor's deeds—and fears that he has already irreparably failed.

### Morale
In a fight, Ismark would first seek to mediate the parties' conflict, but would gladly draw his sword—and even fight to the death—if he believed that he was fighting for something or someone worth protecting.

### Relationships
Ismark is the adoptive brother of [[Ireena Kolyana]], and the great-grandson of Ismark the Great.
