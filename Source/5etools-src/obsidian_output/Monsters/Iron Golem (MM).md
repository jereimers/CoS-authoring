## Traits

**Fire Absorption.** Whenever the golem is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the fire damage dealt.

**Immutable Form.** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The golem makes two melee attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.

**Sword.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h23 (**3d10 + 7**) slashing damage.

**Poison Breath {@recharge 5}.** The golem exhales poisonous gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (**10d8**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
