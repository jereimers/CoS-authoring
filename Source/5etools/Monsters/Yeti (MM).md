## Traits

**Fear of Fire.** If the yeti takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

**Keen Smell.** The yeti has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Snow Camouflage.** The yeti has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The yeti can use its Chilling Gaze and makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) slashing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) cold damage.

**Chilling Gaze.** The yeti targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the yeti, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (**3d6**) cold damage and then be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute, unless it is immune to cold damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Chilling Gaze of all yetis (but not abominable yetis) for 1 hour.
