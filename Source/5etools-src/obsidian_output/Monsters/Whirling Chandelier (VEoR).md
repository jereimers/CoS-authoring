## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the chandelier is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the chandelier move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the chandelier is animate.

**Fiery Aura.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the chandelier takes 7 (**2d6**) fire damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The chandelier makes three Chain attacks, three Lamp attacks, or a combination thereof.

**Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the chandelier.

**Lamp.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (**3d8**) fire damage.

**Blazing Vortex {@recharge 5}.** Each creature within 20 feet of the chandelier and not behind Cover must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (**8d8**) fire damage and have the [[blinded]] condition until the start of the chandelier's next turn.
