## Traits

**Life Hunger.** If a creature the Hungry can see regains hit points, the Hungry gains two benefits until the end of its next turn: it has advantage on attack rolls, and its bite deals an extra 22 (**4d10**) necrotic damage on a hit.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Hungry makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) necrotic damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**4d6 + 4**) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16) and is [[restrained]] until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, the Hungry can't attack with its claws.
