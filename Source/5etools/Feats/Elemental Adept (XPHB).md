# Elemental Adept

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Energy Mastery

Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder. Spells you cast ignore [[Resistance|XPHB]] to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you roll damage for a spell you cast that deals damage of that type, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2.

## Repeatable

You can take this feat more than once, but you must choose a different damage type each time for Energy Mastery.
