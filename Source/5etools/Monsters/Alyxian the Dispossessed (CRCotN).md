## Traits

**Divinely Blessed.** Alyxian can't be [[surprised]] and can't be changed into another form against his will.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Special Equipment.** Alyxian carries a magic dagger that he uses to make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. In the hands of creatures other than Alyxian, the dagger is nonmagical and has no special properties.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage, or 8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (**2d8**) radiant damage.

**Stoneheart Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h11 (**3d4 + 4**) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become [[petrified]] as the dagger lodges itself in the target's body. While the dagger is lodged in the target, magic can't end the [[petrified]] condition on it and Alyxian can't make Stoneheart Dagger attacks. A creature within reach of the [[petrified]] target can use an action to try to remove the dagger, doing so with a successful DC 17 Strength check.


## Bonus Actions

**Summon Dagger.** Alyxian's Stoneheart Dagger teleports into his free hand, provided he has one.


## Reactions

**Parry.** Alyxian adds 3 to his AC against one attack roll that would hit him. To do so, Alyxian must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.


## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** Alyxian makes one Spear or Stoneheart Dagger attack.

**Warrior's Stride.** Alyxian moves up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Ruidium Shard (Costs 2 Actions).** A gem-sized shard of ruidium appears at a point Alyxian can see within 120 feet of himself and explodes. Each creature, other than Alyxian, in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. If a creature isn't suffering from ruidium corruption, it becomes corrupted when it fails the saving throw.
