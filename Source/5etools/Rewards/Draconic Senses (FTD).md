# Draconic Senses

*Draconic Gift*

You gain keen senses like a dragon's.

## Blindsight

You have [[blindsight]] to a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind cover, even if you're [[blinded]] or in darkness. Moreover, you can see [[invisible]] creatures within that range, unless the creatures successfully hide from you.

## Keen Senses

You have advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks.
