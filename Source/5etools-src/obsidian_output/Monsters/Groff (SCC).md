## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the groff is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the groff move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the groff isn't an ordinary moss-covered bog patch.

**Hold Breath.** The groff can hold its breath for up to 1 hour.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The groff makes one Bite attack and one Swamp Claw attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) piercing damage.

**Swamp Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become engulfed by the groff. While engulfed, the target can't breathe, is [[restrained]], and takes 10 (**3d6**) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. When the groff moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The groff can have only one target engulfed at a time.

An engulfed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns. On a success, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.
