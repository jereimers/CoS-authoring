*6th-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and dust)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [[Wall of Force|XPHB]].

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes **10d6 + 40** Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a [[True Resurrection|XPHB]] or a [[Wish|XPHB]] spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-[[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] portion of it.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `10d6 + 40` for each spell slot level above 6.
