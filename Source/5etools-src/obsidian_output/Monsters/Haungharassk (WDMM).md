## Traits

**Salt Sensitivity.** A pound of salt thrown onto the snail's skin deals **1d6** acid damage to the creature.

**Magical Properties.** A creature that uses an action to touch the living snail gains 6 temporary hit points that last for 24 hours. Any creature or object that touches the living snail also gains the benefit of a [[remove curse]] spell. The snail loses these magical properties if it dies.

**Spider Climb.** The snail can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
