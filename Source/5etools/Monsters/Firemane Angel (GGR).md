## Traits

**Flyby.** The angel doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Magic Resistance.** The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the angel takes 21 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The angel makes two melee attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) slashing damage, or 11 (**1d10 + 6**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 22 (**5d8**) fire or radiant damage (angel's choice).
