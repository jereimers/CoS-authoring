## Traits

**Immutable Form.** The warbler is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Telepathic Bond.** While the warbler is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with each other.


## Actions

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Calming Mist {@recharge 5}.** The warbler releases a calming gas in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Charisma saving throw or become [[charmed]] by the warbler for 1 minute. While [[charmed]] in this way, the creature is [[incapacitated]] and has a speed of 0.
