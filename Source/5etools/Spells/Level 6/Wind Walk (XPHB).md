# Wind Walk

*6th-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a candle)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

---

You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] of 300 feet and can hover; it has [[Immunity|XPHB]] to the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition; and it has [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the [[Dash|XPHB]] action or a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the [[Stunned|XPHB]] condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a [[Magic|XPHB]] action followed by a 1-minute transformation.

If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance.
