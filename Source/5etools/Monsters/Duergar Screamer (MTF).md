## Traits

**Engine of Pain.** Once per turn, a creature that attacks the screamer can target the duergar trapped in it. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 11 (**2d10**) damage to the screamer, and the screamer can respond by using its Multiattack with its reaction.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The screamer makes one drill attack and uses its Sonic Scream.

**Drill.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d12 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Sonic Scream.** The screamer emits destructive energy in a 15-foot cube. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) thunder damage and be knocked [[prone]].
