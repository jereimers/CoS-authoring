**Hellish Restoration.** If the swarm dies in the Nine Hells, it revives with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] in `1d10` days unless it is killed by a creature under the effects of a [[Bless|XPHB]] spell or its remains are sprinkled with Holy Water.

**Vile Slime.** m +4, reach 5 ft. @h11 (**2d8 + 2**) Poison damage, or 9 (**2d6 + 2**) Poison damage if the swarm is [[Bloodied]].
