# Hat of Vermin

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a [[Bat|XMM]], a [[Frog|XMM]], or a [[Rat|XMM]]. The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is [[Indifferent [Attitude]|XPHB]] toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
