## Traits

**Boundless Movement.** The farastu ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed. It can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically remove the [[grappled]] condition from itself.

**Magic Resistance.** The farastu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The farastu can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The farastu makes two Claw attacks and one Bite attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 15, with disadvantage). The farastu has two claws, each of which can grapple one creature.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit (with advantage against a creature the farastu is grappling), reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 24 (**7d6**) acid damage.

**Summon Demodand (1/Day).** The farastu has a 40 percent chance of summoning 1 farastu demodand. A summoned demodand appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the farastu, acts as an ally of the farastu, and can't summon other demodands. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the farastu dies, or until the farastu dismisses it as an action.
