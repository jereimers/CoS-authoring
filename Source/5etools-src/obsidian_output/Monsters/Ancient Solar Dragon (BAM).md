## Traits

**Flyby.** The dragon doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Nebulous Thoughts.** Magical attempts to read the dragon's mind or glean its thoughts fail automatically.

**Siege Monster.** The dragon deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Unusual Nature.** The dragon doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and one Tail attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d6 + 9**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) radiant damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h13 (**1d8 + 9**) bludgeoning damage.

**Photonic Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a flashing mote of radiant energy that travels to a point the dragon can see within 240 feet of itself, then blossoms into a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 66 (**12d10**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes one Tail attack.

**Blinding Brilliance (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon emits magical light in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in this area must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn.
