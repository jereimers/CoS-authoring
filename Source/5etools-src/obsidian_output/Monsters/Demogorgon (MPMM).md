## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Demogorgon fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Two Heads.** Demogorgon has advantage on saving throws against being [[blinded]], [[deafened]], [[stunned]], or knocked [[unconscious]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Demogorgon makes two Tentacle attacks. He can replace one attack with a use of Gaze.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h28 (**3d12 + 9**) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

**Gaze.** Demogorgon turns his magical gaze toward one creature he can see within 120 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following effects (choose one or roll a `d6`):

- **1–2: Beguiling Gaze:** The target is [[stunned]] until the start of Demogorgon's next turn or until Demogorgon is no longer within line of sight.
- **3–4: Confusing Gaze:** The target suffers the effect of the [[confusion]] spell without making a saving throw. The effect lasts until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spell.
- **5–6: Hypnotic Gaze:** The target is [[charmed]] by Demogorgon until the start of Demogorgon's next turn. Demogorgon chooses how the [[charmed]] target uses its action, reaction, and movement.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Gaze.** Demogorgon uses Gaze and must use either Beguiling Gaze or Confusing Gaze.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h20 (**2d10 + 9**) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (**2d10**) necrotic damage.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Demogorgon uses Spellcasting.
