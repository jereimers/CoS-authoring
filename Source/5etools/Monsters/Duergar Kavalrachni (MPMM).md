## Traits

**Cavalry Training.** When the duergar hits a target with a melee attack while mounted, the mount can use its reaction to make one melee attack against the same target.

**Duergar Resilience.** The duergar has advantage on saving throws against spells and the [[charmed]], [[paralyzed]], and [[poisoned]] conditions.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The duergar makes two War Pick attacks.

**War Pick.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage plus 5 (**2d4**) poison damage.

**Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d10**) piercing damage.

**Shared Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The duergar magically turns [[invisible]] for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it forces a creature to make a saving throw, or its [[concentration]] is broken (as if [[concentration]] on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is [[invisible]] with it. While the [[invisible]] duergar is mounted, the mount is [[invisible]] as well. The invisibility ends early on the mount immediately after it attacks.
