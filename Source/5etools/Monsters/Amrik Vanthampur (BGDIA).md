## Traits

**Suave Defense.** While Amrik is wearing light or no armor and wielding no shield, his AC includes his Charisma modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Amrik makes three dagger attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Smoke Bomb (1/Day).** Amrik hurls a smoke bomb up to 20 feet away. The bomb explodes on impact, creating a cloud of black smoke that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere. The area within the cloud is heavily obscured. A strong wind disperses the cloud, which otherwise remains until the end of Amrik's next turn.
