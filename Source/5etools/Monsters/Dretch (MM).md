## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d6**) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**2d4**) slashing damage.

**Fetid Cloud (1/Day).** A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of its next turn. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
