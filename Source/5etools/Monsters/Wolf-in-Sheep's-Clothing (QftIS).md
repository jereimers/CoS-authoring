## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is motionless (except for its lure) at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing move or act (except for the lure), that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is animate.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing makes one Bite attack and two Root Tentacle attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) acid damage.

**Root Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16). While [[grappled]] in this way, the target has the [[restrained]] condition, and at the start of each of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's turns, the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can pull the target up to 10 feet toward itself (no action required). The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing has four root tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.


## Bonus Actions

**Completely Harmless Lure.** The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can change the color, texture, and shape of its lure to resemble a Tiny Beast or Tiny object. It can move the lure to reinforce the resemblance (no action required), but the lure must remain within 15 feet of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing, connected by nearly [[invisible]] filament-like tendrils.
