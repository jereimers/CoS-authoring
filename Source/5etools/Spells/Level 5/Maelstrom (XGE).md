# Maelstrom

*5th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (paper or leaf in the shape of a funnel)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling mass of 5-foot-deep water appears in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within range. The point must be on the ground or in a body of water. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take **6d6** bludgeoning damage and be pulled 10 feet toward the center.
