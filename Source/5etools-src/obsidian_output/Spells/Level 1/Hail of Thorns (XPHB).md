# Hail of Thorns

*1st-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus (which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Ranged weapon)  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

As you hit the creature, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your Ranged weapon or ammunition. The target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it make a Dexterity saving throw, taking **1d10** Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `1d10` for each spell slot level above 1.
