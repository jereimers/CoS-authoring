## Traits

**Tunneler.** The aurumvorax can burrow through solid rock and metal at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The aurumvorax makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature wearing armor of any type, the aurumvorax regains 4 (`1d6 + 1`) hit points.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the aurumvorax can't use its Claw attack on another target, and when it moves, it can drag the [[grappled]] creature with it, without the aurumvorax's speed being halved.
