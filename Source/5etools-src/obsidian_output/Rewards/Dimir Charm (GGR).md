# Dimir Charm

*Charm*

When you activate this charm, you can cast the [[blink]] or [[sleep]] (3rd-level version) spell. Alternatively, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn [[invisible]] and teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain [[invisible]] until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. The charm vanishes after you activate it.
