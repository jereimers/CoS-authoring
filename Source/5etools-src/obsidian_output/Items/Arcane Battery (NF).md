# Arcane Battery

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This smooth, oval stone is etched with faintly glowing, magical symbols. While holding the battery, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to touch the battery to one magic item. If that magic item normally regains expended charges daily, it immediately regains `1d4 + 1` expended charges, and the battery loses its magic.
