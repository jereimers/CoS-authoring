## Traits

**Blight Seeds.** When it finishes a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], the blight expels `1d6` seeds into unoccupied spaces on the ground within 30 feet of itself. After 24 hours, the seeds become creatures under the blight's control. Roll `1d8` for each seed to determine the creature it becomes: on 1-4, [[Twig Blight|XMM]]; on 5-6, [[Needle Blight|XMM]]; on 7-8, [[Vine Blight|XMM]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The blight makes two attacks, using Slam or Thorn Volley in any combination. It also uses Life-Draining Root.

**Slam.** m +12, reach 10 ft. @h25 (**4d8 + 7**) Bludgeoning damage.

**Thorn Volley.** r +12, range 60/180 ft. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) Piercing damage.

**Life-Draining Root.** con DC 20, one Huge or smaller creature the blight can see within 30 feet. @actSaveFail 14 (**2d6 + 7**) Necrotic damage, and the target has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 17) from one of six roots. Until the grapple ends, the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and takes 14 (**4d6**) Necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The target's [[Hit Points|XPHB]] maximum decreases by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken, and the blight regains [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to that amount.
