## Actions

**Multiattack.** The thri-kreen makes two Gythka attacks and one Chatkcha attack.

**Gythka.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit (with advantage if the thri-kreen is missing any hit points), reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Chatkcha.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit (with advantage if the thri-kreen is missing any hit points), range 30/120 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) slashing damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Leap.** The thri-kreen leaps up to 20 feet in any direction, provided its speed isn't 0.


## Reactions

**Parry.** The thri-kreen adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the thri-kreen must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
