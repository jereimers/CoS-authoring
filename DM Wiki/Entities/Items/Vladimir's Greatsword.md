# Vladimir's Greatsword

## Description
A magnificent **+2 greatsword** wielded by [[Vladimir Horngaard]], the revenant commander of the Order of the Silver Dragon. This weapon is a masterwork of craftsmanship, designed to honor the order's patron, the silver dragon [[Argynvost]].

The greatsword's hilt is sculpted to resemble **silver dragon wings**, spreading elegantly from the crossguard. The pommel is shaped like a **silver dragon's head**, its jaws clutching a **black opal** between its teeth. This dark gemstone seems to pulse with the hatred that animates Vladimir's undead form.

- **Type:** Martial Melee Weapon (Greatsword)
- **Damage:** 4d6 + 6 slashing (includes +2 magical bonus and Vladimir's +4 Strength modifier)
- **Attack Bonus:** +9 to hit
- **Properties:** Heavy, Two-Handed
