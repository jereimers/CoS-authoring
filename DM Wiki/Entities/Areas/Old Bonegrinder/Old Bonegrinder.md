# Overview

The Old Bonegrinder is a squat stone windmill of ill omen, situated along the [[Old Svalich Road]] between [[Tser Falls]] and [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. Once known as the Durst Mill, the party actually holds a deed to this property—discovered during their harrowing escape from the [[Haunted House|Durst House]]. However, the windmill is currently occupied by [[Morgantha]] and her daughters, who have made it clear they have no intention of vacating.

# What the party knows

- The party possesses a deed to the windmill from the [[Haunted House|Durst Estate]]
- [[Morgantha]] and her daughters currently reside there and refuse to acknowledge the party's claim
- [[Morgantha]] threatened to use the deed as kindling if the party cited it again
- [[Morgantha]] gave each party member a free [[Dream Pastry]], recommending they be enjoyed after a meal with red wine
- [[Varnish Gothorn|Varnish]] had previously consumed one of [[Morgantha]]'s pastries and experienced disturbing visions of amber tombs and cosmic suffering

<!-- DM-Only Start -->
The Old Bonegrinder is the lair of a coven of night hags who use it to produce [[Dream Pastry|Dream Pastries]]—enchanted confections made from the life force of children. Morgantha and her daughters are far more dangerous than they appear.
<!-- DM-Only End -->
