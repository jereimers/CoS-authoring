## Traits

**Incorporeal Movement.** The allip can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Unusual Nature.** The allip doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Maddening Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**4d6 + 3**) psychic damage.

**Howling Babble {@recharge}.** Each creature within 30 feet of the allip that can hear it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 12 (**2d8 + 3**) psychic damage, and it is [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [[stunned]]. Constructs and Undead are immune to this effect.

**Whispers of Compulsion.** The allip chooses up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, or it takes 12 (**2d8 + 3**) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature of the allip's choice that the allip can see. Constructs and Undead are immune to this effect.
