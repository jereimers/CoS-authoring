# Tumble

**Time:** 1 action, 1 bonus

A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.
