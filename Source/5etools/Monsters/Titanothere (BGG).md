## Traits

**Beast of Burden.** The titanothere is considered to be one size larger for the purpose of determining its carrying capacity.


## Actions

**Stomp.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage. If the titanothere moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 13 (**3d8**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition if it is a creature.
