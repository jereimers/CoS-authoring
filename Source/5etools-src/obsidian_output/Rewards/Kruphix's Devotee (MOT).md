# Kruphix's Devotee

*Piety Trait*

*Piety 3+ Kruphix trait*

As a devotee of Kruphix, you have proven yourself a devotee of reality's mysteries and laws. You can cast [[detect magic]] with this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, you know the [[mage hand]] cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
