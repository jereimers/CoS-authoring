%% A session is a unit of play in which the players meet in person, enact one or more scenes/encounters, and then adjourn. Sessions have recaps and dates, and can span across boundaries of arc/act. %%

# A Breakfast of Borscht

- Arden went for an early morning walk, meeting Szoldar and Yevgeni on their way to check their traps
- The party was visited by Erasmus Van Richten's ghost in their room at the Blue Water Inn (see [[Arc H - The Lost Soul#H1. Erasmus' Plea]])
- They learned from Urwin that the "Victor" written on the window was likely to be the baron's son.
- They still have sneaky suspicions about Rictavio, but didn't have time to pursue.

# Visiting the Vistani

- Walking west along the Svalich Road then south via a wooded path, they beheld the Vistani Camp ringed by Dusk Elf hovels built into the hill
- They approached a Dusk Elf guard, Savid, and asked where they could find the Vistani girl for whom they carried a gift. Savid (the one who discovered Yan's body) winced and gave them a grim smirk before pointing them up the hill to the large central tent.
- Leaning in through the tent's open entryway, they beheld the scene described in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#Entering the Vistani Camp]]. They met Luvash and Arrigal, learned what he knows about his daughter's disappearance, and promised to help find Arabelle. Luvash told them to visit Kasimir to retrieve the signet ring and also told them where to find the presumed site of the abduction.

# Tea with Kasimir

- Met Kasimir Velikov. Arden used his Lay On Hands paladin ability to heal Kasimir's frostbitten hand. Kasimir told them he knew not what meaning the ring held, but knew the significance of the two symbols on its face (necromancy and evocation schools of magic). 
- Arden, interest piqued at meeting a new kind of elf he didn't know existed, asked Kasimir about the history of his people. The party sat down for storytime while Kasimir related his tale (see [[Kasimir's Tale]])
- Arden produced his [[Broken Blade]], prompting Kasimir to embrace him as family, as clearly the blade had chosen to find its way to the paladin for a reason. The two swore that the blade would bring vengeance to Rahadin and Strahd.

# CSI: Luna River

- Before returning to Vallaki, the foursome (plus Ireena) ventured further west to visit the site of Arabelle's disappearance. Passing through the [[Luna River Crossroads]], they were beset by twig blights and scarecrows (see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E5b. Luna River Crossroads]]), but dispatched them easily. 
- Reaching the riverside clearing where Yan's headless body lay, Fig did some solid investigatory work to piece together what had happened (see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#^Abstract-Tracking-Arabelle]] for details on what they learned). Climbing the tree where one set of footprints stopped, Fig found a torn shred of silk fabric on which Arden was able to detect a whiff of undead energy. The party recalled the visage of [[Escher]], Strahd's vampire spawn coachman whom they met at the [[River Ivlis Crossroads]] in [[Session 05 - Out of Barovia]] (see [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C2a. Strahd’s Arrival]] for description)
