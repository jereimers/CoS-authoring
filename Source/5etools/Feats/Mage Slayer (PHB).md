# Mage Slayer

You have practiced techniques useful in melee combat against spellcasters, gaining the following benefits:

- When a creature within 5 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
- When you damage a creature that is [[concentration]] on a spell, that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain its [[concentration]].
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells cast by creatures within 5 feet of you.
