## Traits

**Charge.** If the hart moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with an antlers attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (**2d6**) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Heated Body.** A creature that touches the hart or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (**1d10**) fire damage.

**Sure-Footed.** The hart has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [[prone]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hart makes two attacks: one with its antlers and one with its hooves.

**Antlers.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (**1d4**) fire damage.
