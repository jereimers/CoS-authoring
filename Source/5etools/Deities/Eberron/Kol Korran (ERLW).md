# Kol Korran

**Pantheon:** Eberron  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Trickery  
**Symbol:** Nine-sided gold coin {@i or} white dragon

Kol Korran is the Sovereign of World and Wealth. He guards travelers and guides traders. Although the Trickery domain is suggested for his clerics, Kol Korran guides fair negotiation; those driven solely by greed prefer the Keeper of the Dark Six.
