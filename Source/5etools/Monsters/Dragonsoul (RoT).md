## Traits

**Dragon Fanatic.** The dragonsoul has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]]. While the dragonsoul can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, the dragonsoul ignores the effects of being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]].

**Fanatic Advantage.** Once per turn, if the dragonsoul makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 10 (**3d6**) damage.

**Limited Flight.** The dragonsoul can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

**Pack Tactics.** The dragonsoul has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dragonsoul's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Dragonsoul attacks twice with its shortsword.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) damage of the type to which the dragonsoul has resistance.

**Orb of Dragon's Breath (3/Day).** Ranged Spell Attack +7 to hit, range 90 ft., one target. @h27 (**6d8**) damage of the type to which the dragonsoul has damage resistance.
