## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Lost makes two arm spike attacks.

**Arm Spike.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Embrace.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h25 (**4d10 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14) if it is a Medium or smaller creature. Until the grapple ends, the target is [[frightened]], and it takes 27 (**6d8**) psychic damage at the end of each of its turns. The Lost can embrace only one creature at a time.



## Reactions

**Tightening Embrace.** If the Lost takes damage while it has a creature [[grappled]], that creature takes 18 (**4d8**) psychic damage.
