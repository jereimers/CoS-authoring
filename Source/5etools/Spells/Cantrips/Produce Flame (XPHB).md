# Produce Flame

*Cantrip conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

---

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes **1d8** Fire damage.

## Cantrip Upgrade

The damage increases by **1d8** when you reach levels 5 (**2d8**), 11 (**3d8**), and 17 (**4d8**).
