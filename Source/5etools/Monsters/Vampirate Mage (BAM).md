## Traits

**Explode.** When the mage is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a cloud of ash. Any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (**2d10**) necrotic damage.

**Spider Climb.** The mage can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Unusual Nature.** The mage doesn't require air or drink.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The mage makes two Ray of Cold attacks.

**Energy Drain.** Attack (ms,rs) +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one creature. @h22 (**4d10**) necrotic damage. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies and instantly transforms into a free-willed shadow under the DM's control.

**Ray of Cold.** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d8 + 2**) cold damage.
