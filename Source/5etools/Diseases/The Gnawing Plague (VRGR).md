# The Gnawing Plague

The Gnawing Plague, also known as "the Gnaws," is known in every corner of Richemulot.

## Transmission

The Gnaws is spread when a creature is bitten by a [[rat]], [[giant rat]], [[swarm of rats]], or [[wererat]] that carries the disease, or by coming into physical contact with an infected creature.

## Infection

Creatures exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become infected. The DC of this saving throw can increase depending on the severity of the plague's spread (see "[[Cycle of the Plague|VRGR]]" below).

## Symptoms

It takes `1d2` days for the Gnawing Plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. The infected creature then gains 1 level of [[exhaustion]], regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice, and regains no hit points from finishing a long rest.

The plague's symptoms include buboes, fatigue, splotchy rashes, sweats, and shaking, particularly facial tremors. Locals liken these twitches to the sniffing of rats. Sufferers often have scraps of leather placed in their mouths to prevent their teeth from clattering, though they inevitably gnaw through these scraps.

## Recovery

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. On a successful save, the creature's [[exhaustion]] level decreases by 1. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [[exhaustion]] below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

## Immunity

All forms of rats and wererats are immune to the Gnawing Plague.
