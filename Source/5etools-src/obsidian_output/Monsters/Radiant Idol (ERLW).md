## Traits

**Aura of False Divinity.** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the radiant idol must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, provided the radiant idol isn't [[incapacitated]]. On a failed save, the creature is [[charmed]] by the radiant idol. A creature [[charmed]] in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the saving throw, a creature is immune to this radiant idol's Aura of False Divinity for 24 hours.

**Magic Resistance.** The radiant idol has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The radiant idol makes two melee attacks.

**Flail.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (**4d8**) radiant damage.

**Radiant Strike (1/Day).** The radiant idol chooses a point on the ground it can see within 60 feet of it. A 30-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light appears there until the start of the radiant idol's next turn. Each creature in the cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (**8d8**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
