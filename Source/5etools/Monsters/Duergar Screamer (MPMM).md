## Actions

**Multiattack.** The screamer makes one Drill attack, and it uses Sonic Scream.

**Drill.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d12 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Sonic Scream.** The screamer emits destructive energy in a 15-foot cube. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) thunder damage and be knocked [[prone]].



## Reactions

**Engine of Pain.** Immediately after a creature within 5 feet of the screamer hits it with an attack roll, the screamer makes a Drill attack against that creature.
