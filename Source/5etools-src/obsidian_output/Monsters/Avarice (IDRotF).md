## Traits

**Icy Doom.** When Avarice dies, her corpse freezes for 9 days, during which time it can't be thawed, harmed by fire, animated, or raised from the dead.

**Special Equipment.** Avarice wields a [[staff of frost]] with 10 charges (see "Actions" below).


## Actions

**Fire Bolt (Cantrip).** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d10**) fire damage.

**Staff of Frost.** While holding this staff, Avarice can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 14): [[cone of cold]] (5 charges), [[fog cloud]] (1 charge), [[ice storm]] (4 charges), or [[wall of ice]] (4 charges). The staff regains `1d6 + 4` charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a `d20`; on a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.



## Reactions

**Banishing Rebuke (Recharges after a Long Rest).** When Avarice is damaged by a creature that she can see within 60 feet of her, she can banish that creature to a frigid extradimensional prison for 1 minute. While there, the creature is [[incapacitated]] and takes 5 (**1d10**) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw, escaping the prison on a success and reappearing in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. A creature that dies in the prison is trapped there indefinitely.
