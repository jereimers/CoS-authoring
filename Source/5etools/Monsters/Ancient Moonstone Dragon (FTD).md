**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) radiant damage.

**Breath Weapon {@recharge 5}.** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons:

- **Dream Breath:** The dragon exhales mist in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall [[unconscious]] for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
- **Moonlight Breath:** The dragon exhales a beam of moonlight in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 60 (**11d10**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
