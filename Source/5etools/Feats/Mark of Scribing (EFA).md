# Mark of Scribing

You gain the following benefits.

## Gifted Scribe

When you make an Intelligence ([[History|XPHB]]) check or an ability check using [[Calligrapher's Supplies|XPHB]], you can roll `1d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

## Scribe's Insight

You know the [[Message|XPHB]] cantrip. You also always have the [[Comprehend Languages|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat).

When you reach character level 3, you also always have the [[Magic Mouth|XPHB]] spell prepared and can cast it the same way.

## Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Scribing Spells table are added to that feature's spell list.
