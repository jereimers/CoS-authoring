# Objective
Help [[Arturi Radanavich]] find a scholar named [[Rictavio|Rudolph van Richten]]. 
# What the Party knows
- [[Arturi Radanavich]] is a cursed Vistana the party met at the [[Tser Pool Encampment]]. He carries a quiet, almost painful sincerity and seems to exist on the outskirts of Vistani society.
- Arturi asked the party if they had encountered a man named Rudolph van Richten in the village of Barovia. He claimed Van Richten was an "acquaintance" he had heard rumors about, but something about his words seemed off.
- Arturi departed the camp before dusk, warning that his presence endangered the camp after dark. When pressed, he admitted that the undead pursue him wherever he goes—a curse placed upon him eighteen years ago.
- Arturi shared a cryptic tale at the campfire about a Fox, Sparrows, and Rats—a story he claimed was true, though he declined to elaborate on its meaning.

# Leads
- Arturi is searching for someone named Rudolph van Richten, who may be somewhere in Barovia.
- [[Doru]] mentioned that a traveling scholar named "Alanik Ray" accompanied his rebellion against Castle Ravenloft—a man who owned a pet monkey and had argued fiercely with Doru before the march.
- Arturi mentioned he had recovered a supply cache in Barovia containing a half-written manuscript and weapons, but has been unable to locate the doctor himself.

# Secrets
- Van Richten is currently in Vallaki, disguised as the carnival ringmaster [[Rictavio]].
- Arturi's curse stems from his family's role in kidnapping Van Richten's son Erasmus and selling him to a vampire lord. Van Richten's words—"Undead take you as you have taken my son"—became a literal curse.
- The tale Arturi told (the Fox and the Sparrows) is an allegory for Van Richten's tragedy: the Fox is Van Richten, the Sparrows are the Radanavich Vistani, and Arturi is the lone surviving "chick."
- Van Richten doesn't need to die to lift Arturi's curse—only to forgive him sincerely.
# Objective
Help [[Arturi Radanavich]] find the man who cursed him—a scholar named [[Rictavio|Rudolph van Richten]]—so that Arturi might lift the curse that has haunted him for eighteen years.
