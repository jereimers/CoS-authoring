## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Faerl has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put him to sleep.


## Actions

**Rapier.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 1**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** Faerl adds 2 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, he must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
