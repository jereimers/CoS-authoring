Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]].

Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes **3d6** Bludgeoning damage, and it has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

A [[Restrained|XPHB]] creature can take an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.
