# Fount of Moonlight

*4th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

A cool light wreathes your body for the duration, emitting [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 20 feet.

Until the spell ends, you have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Radiant damage, and your melee attacks deal an extra **2d6** Radiant damage on a hit.

In addition, immediately after you take damage from a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition until the end of your next turn.
