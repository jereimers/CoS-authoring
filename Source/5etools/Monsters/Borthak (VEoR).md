## Traits

**Glacial Aura.** At the end of the borthak's turn, slippery ice covers surfaces within 10 feet of the borthak. This ice is difficult terrain. When a creature other than the borthak enters the ice's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition. The ice disappears at the start of the borthak's next turn.

**Webbed Feet.** The borthak can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The borthak makes one Bite attack or uses Noxious Regurgitation if available, and it makes two Stomp attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) acid damage.

**Stomp.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.

**Noxious Regurgitation {@recharge 5}.** The borthak spews acid at a creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 24 (**7d6**) acid damage and has the [[poisoned]] condition until the start of the borthak's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.



## Reactions

**Reactive Tail.** When a creature within 10 feet of the borthak hits the borthak with an attack roll, the borthak swings its tail in retaliation. The triggering creature and any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (**2d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.


## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Move.** The borthak moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Bite (Costs 2 Actions).** The borthak makes one Bite attack.
