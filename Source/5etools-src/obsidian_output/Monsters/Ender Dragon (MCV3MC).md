## Traits

**Dragon Egg.** When the Ender Dragon drops to 0 hit points, it radiates beams of purple light and then disappears, leaving behind an inert, jet-black dragon egg worth 5,000 gp.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and uses Beating Wings.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit; reach 15 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d6 + 8**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage.

**Beating Wings.** The dragon beats its great wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (**1d4 + 8**) bludgeoning damage, be pushed 10 feet away from the dragon, and have the [[prone]] condition.

**Harmful Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales putrid gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (**15d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The dragon then chooses a point it can see where the cone makes contact with the ground. That point becomes the center of a 10-foot-high, 10-foot-radius cylinder of lingering gas that disappears at the start of the dragon's next turn. Any creature that starts its turn in the cylinder takes 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage.
