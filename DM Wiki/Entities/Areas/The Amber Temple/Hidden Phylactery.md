# X28. Hidden Phylactery

The secret door to this room has an arcane lock spell cast on it (see area X27 for details).

Behind the secret door is a small, dusty room. Rising from the floor in the eastern half of the room is a scaly arm and claw clutching a small box made of bone.

The scaly arm is merely a carved pedestal. The bone box is Exethanter's phylactery. If it takes 20 or more radiant damage from a single source, the phylactery is destroyed.
