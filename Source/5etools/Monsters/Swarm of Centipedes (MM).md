## Traits

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. @h10 (**4d4**) piercing damage, or 5 (**2d4**) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by a swarm of centipedes is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.
