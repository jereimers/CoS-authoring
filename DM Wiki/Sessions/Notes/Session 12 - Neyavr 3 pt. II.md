%% A session is a unit of play in which the players meet in person, enact one or more scenes/encounters, and then adjourn. Sessions have recaps and dates, and can span across boundaries of arc/act. %%

We pick up with the party just outside the coffin-maker's shop.

3. [[D4 - Coffin Maker's Shop]] - general description of the shop, including Henrik's schedule
4. [[D4a - Entering the Shop]] - how to break in, since Henrik won't let them in.
5. [[D4b - Recovering the Bones]] - Henrik tells them where to find the bones, explains why he's in this position, warns them about the vampire nest, asks them to keep him safe from reprisals. They should check for traps with two different Investigation checks! If Noisemaker goes off, start initiative. 
	1. [[Poison Needle (DMG)]] first: DC 20 investigation check, DC 15 DEX with Thieves' Tools (Which Varnish has) to disarm. 
	2. Noisemaker second: DC 20 investigation to detect, DC 20 DEX (thieves' tools) to disarm.

6. [[D4c - Volenta Popofsky's Trap]] - Combat with Volenta and her spawn. Remember that Volenta flees after being reduced to 0, she does not stay and fight.
7. When the bones are recovered and returned to the church, Lucian invites Ireena to stay at the church as long as she desires. (*Rahadin's visit won't happen until after Lady Fiona has taken power*)


Note that Ireena will want to speak with the Baron as described in [[Act II Summary#^Abstract-Ireenas-Diplomacy|Ireena's Diplomacy]] -- something else that they'll need to work into the schedule for the day. 

# First evening (Neyavr 3)
This night, they'll receive Lady Wachter's invitation, delivered by Ernst Larnak.


It's also possible that Ireena can speak with the Baron when the party goes to visit the mansion to investigate the signet ring in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E3. Burgomaster’s Mansion|Arc E]].

# Arabelle sequence

This begins when the players take the toy they purchased from Blinsky to the Vistani Camp, a half-hour's walk southwest of the village.

1. Read the description of the Vistani Camp ([[05_Chapter 5 - The Town of Vallaki#N9. Vistani Camp|WOTC]]) and offer them a choice -- up the hill, or speak to one fo the guards
2. **If up the hill:** [[E2a - The Vistani Encampment]], read what's happening in the tent, and the players have a conversation with Luvash, and he asks them for help with the ring, and he sends them to Kasimir to retrieve it.
	1. **Investigate the site of her disappearance?** if the party wants to track Arabelle from the site of her disappearance, allow them to do it but be mindful of the time of day. If it's nighttime, run a random encounter when they reach [[02_Chapter 2 - The Lands of Barovia#P. Luna River Crossroads|P. Luna River Crossroads]]
3. **If speak to guard:** They can direct the players up the hill (if they inquire about the Vistani) or to Kasimir's hovel. If Kasimir, they note that Kasimir has recently returned from a long and arduous journey and that the players must not disturb him beyond what is reasonably necessary.
4. [[E2c - Kasimir’s Hovel]] - read the description! Then introduce Kasimir "sitting on the green rug facing the fire, meditating". He is a "mutilated, grief-stricken dusk elf"

<div class="description">
<p>
He is thin in the way of men who have survived history rather than lived through it. His dusky skin is ashen, drawn tight over sharp cheekbones, and his long, dark hair—once carefully kept—now hangs loose and is streaked with silver. His violet eyes are alert but hollow, fixed not quite on you, not quite on the present, as if he is listening to something beyond your perception.</p>
<p> His right hand and forearm are a pale bluish-white, with much of the skin puffy and blistered.
</div>

4. Kasimir can share some additional lore if asked: [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#^Info-What-Kasimir-Knows|What Kasimir Knows]]. He can also relate the full story of the dusk elves [[Kasimir's Tale]]
5. Don't forget to give them the ring! ![[signet-ring.png]]
6. Then they shall go to the Burgomaster's Mansion! Ireena's desire to converse with the Baron about the plight of the Barovian refugees might be a good cover. If Ireena occupies the Baron with her conversation, the players can attempt to visit the library by subterfuge. Or, they can appeal to him directly — Ireena wants to talk, the rest want to peruse the library. They're greeted by Claudia, the baron's maid. **The players' goal is to get to the library.** After a full hour searching, they won't find anything about the ring. But they will find something about Ireena's heritage...

![[05_Chapter 5 - The Town of Vallaki#N3l. Library]]

7. In the library they'll meet [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] and see that his spellbook bears the same symbol as the signet ring.
