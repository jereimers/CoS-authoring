## Traits

**Assume Form.** The maurezhi can assume the appearance of any Medium humanoid it has eaten. It remains in this form for `1d6` days, during which time the form gradually decays until, when the effect ends, the form sloughs from the demon's body.

**Magic Resistance.** The maurezhi has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The maurezhi makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, its Charisma score is reduced by `1d4`. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if this reduces its Charisma to 0. It rises 24 hours later as a ghoul, unless it has been revived or its corpse has been destroyed.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Raise Ghoul {@recharge 5}.** The maurezhi targets one dead ghoul or ghast it can see within 30 feet of it. The target is revived with all its hit points.
