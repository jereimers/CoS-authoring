## Traits

**Advanced Telepathy.** The flumph perceives the content of any telepathic communication within 60 feet of it.

**Prone Deficiency.** If the flumph receives the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition, roll a die. On an odd number, it has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition. At the end of each of its turns, the flumph makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, ending the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition on a success.

**Telepathic Shroud.** The flumph's thoughts can't be read by any means, and magic can't detect its location or observe it remotely.


## Actions

**Tentacle.** m +4, reach 5 feet. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) Acid damage.

**Stench Spray (1/Day).** dex DC 10, one creature the flumph can see within 15 feet. @actSaveFail The target is coated in a foul-smelling liquid, exudes a stench for `1d4` hours, and has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition while the stench lasts. Other creatures have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition while in a 5-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the coated target. The target can remove the stench on itself if it bathes during a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
