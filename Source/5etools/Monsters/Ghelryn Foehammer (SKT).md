## Traits

**Dwarven Resilience.** Ghelryn has advantage on saving throws against poison.

**Giant Slayer.** Any weapon attack that Ghelryn makes against a giant deals an extra 7 (**2d6**) damage on a hit.

**Roleplaying Information.** The blacksmith Ghelryn has a good heart, but he hates orcs and giants—hates them with a fiery passion. He considers it the solemn duty of all dwarves to cave in their skulls!

Ideal: "It is incumbent upon every dwarf to forge a legacy."

Bond: "I stand for Clan Foehammer and all dwarvenkind."

Flaw: "I never run from a fight, especially if it involves killing orcs or giants."


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ghelryn makes two battleaxe attacks.

**Battleaxe.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage if used with two hands.
