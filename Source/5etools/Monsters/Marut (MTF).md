## Traits

**Immutable Form.** The marut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the marut fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The marut has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The marut makes two slam attacks.

**Unerring Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h60 force damage, and the target is pushed up to 5 feet away from the marut if it is Huge or smaller.

**Blazing Edict {@recharge 5}.** Arcane energy emanates from the marut's chest in a 60-foot cube. Every creature in that area takes 45 radiant damage. Each creature that takes any of this damage must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of the marut's next turn.

**Justify.** The marut targets up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to a teleportation circle in the Hall of Concordance in Sigil. A target fails automatically if it is [[incapacitated]]. If either target is teleported in this way, the marut teleports with it to the circle.

After teleporting in this way, the marut can't use this action again until it finishes a short or long rest.
