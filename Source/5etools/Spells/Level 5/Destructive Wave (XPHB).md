Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature you choose in the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes **5d6** Thunder damage and **5d6** Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.
