## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Charmayne fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Charmayne makes three Ashen Burst attacks. She can replace one of these attacks with one use of Spellcasting.

**Ashen Burst.** Attack (ms,rs) +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h17 (**5d6**) fire damage.

**Cinder Spite {@recharge 5}.** Charmayne creates a magical explosion of fire centered on a point she can see within 120 feet of herself. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (**10d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and is transformed into a Tiny charcoal figurine.



## Reactions

**Charmayne can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn..** 

**Elemental Rebuke.** In response to being hit by an attack, Charmayne utters a word in Ignan, dealing 10 (**3d6**) fire damage to the attacker. Charmayne then teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space she can see, leaving a harmless cloud of ash and embers in the space she just left.

**Fiery Counterspell.** Charmayne interrupts a creature she can see within 60 feet of herself that is casting a spell. If the spell is 4th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 5th level or higher, Charmayne makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster takes 10 (**3d6**) fire damage if the spell fails.
