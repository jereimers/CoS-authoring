## Traits

**Air Form.** The dust hulk can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.

**Death Burst.** When the dust hulk dies, it explodes in a burst of dust that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have the [[blinded]] condition for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dust hulk makes three Slam attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Stinging Dust.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.

**Stinging Dust.** One creature of the dust hulk's choice inside its space must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (**3d6**) bludgeoning damage and has the [[blinded]] condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
