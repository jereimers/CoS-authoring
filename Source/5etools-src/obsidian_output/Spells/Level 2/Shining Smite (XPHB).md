# Shining Smite

*2nd-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus (which you take immediately after hitting a creature with a Melee weapon or an {@variantrule Unarmed Strike|XPHB})  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

The target hit by the strike takes an extra **2d6** Radiant damage from the attack. Until the spell ends, the target sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 5-foot radius, attack rolls against it have [[Advantage|XPHB]], and it can't benefit from the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `2d6` for each spell slot level above 2.
