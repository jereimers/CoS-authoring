## Traits

**Invisible in Water.** The big water slurpent is [[invisible]] while fully immersed in water.

**Water Bound.** The big water slurpent dies if it leaves the water to which it is bound or if that water is destroyed.


## Actions

**Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, one target. @h13 (**3d6+3**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 13) and pulled 5 feet toward the big water slurpent. Until this [[grapple]] ends, the target is [[restrained]], the big water slurpent tries to drown it, and the big water slurpent can't constrict another target.
