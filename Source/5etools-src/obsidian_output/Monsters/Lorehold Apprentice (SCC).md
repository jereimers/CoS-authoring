## Actions

**Scroll Bash.** Melee Spell Attack +4 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (**2d8**) thunder damage.

**Reduce to Memory {@recharge}.** Thundering golden energy erupts around a creature the apprentice can see within 90 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (**6d10**) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has disadvantage on the saving throw.



## Reactions

**Learn from the Past (2/Day).** When another creature within 60 feet of the apprentice misses a target with an attack roll, the apprentice magically enables the attacker to reroll the attack roll. It must use the new roll.
