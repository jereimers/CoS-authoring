## Traits

**Lightning Affinity.** When Eo uses Spellcasting to cast a spell that deals lightning damage, that spell deals an additional 5 damage. When Eo casts a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, she can change that damage type to lightning: acid, cold, fire, poison, thunder.


## Actions

**Twinned Orbs.** Attack (ms,rs) +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 90 ft., two targets. @h27 (**5d8 + 5**) acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison or thunder damage (Eo's choice).

**Twinned Spell.** Eo uses Spellcasting to cast [[banishment]], dominate person, finger of death, or power word stun. This spell targets a second creature in range.

**Discharge (1/Day).** Eo emits a thin green ray at a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the target takes 89 (**14d6 + 40**) force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a [[wish]] spell.



## Reactions

**Shocking Rebuke.** As a reaction to taking damage, Eo surrounds her attacker with a coil of lightning. The target must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. It takes 16 (**2d10 + 5**) lightning damage on a failed save, half as much damage on a successful one.
