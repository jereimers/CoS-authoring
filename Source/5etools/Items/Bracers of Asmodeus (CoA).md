# Bracers of Asmodeus

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You have a +2 bonus to AC while wearing these bracers, if you do not wear armor or use a shield at the same time.

## Curse

While attuned to the bracers, you become obsessed with plotting, scheming, and manipulation. You always barter for better deals, often using secrets or leveraging other offers in the process. If you ever decline an opportunity to better yourself financially at another's expense, you immediately take **3d10** necrotic damage. Only the [[Remove Curse]] spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

## Corrupting

This item corrupts. See the "[[Infernal Item Corruption|CoA]]" section.
