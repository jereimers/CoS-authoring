# Return to the Ransacked [[Blue Water Inn]]

## DM NOTE:

Izek has only seen Ireena in the context of the party (never by herself). The party was known to be aiding Father Lucian after the church was damaged, so it wouldn't be weird for them to be repeatedly visiting the church. They are also know to be staying at the Blue Water Inn, so it's fair to say that Izek assumed Ireena would be staying at the inn along with the party (and not at the church, which is obviously not a place at which most people would take up temporary residence). His INT and WIS are also super low (10 and 9, respectively) so he couldn't have thought that hard about it.
