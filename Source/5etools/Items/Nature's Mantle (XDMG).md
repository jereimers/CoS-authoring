# Nature's Mantle

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a [[Spellcasting Focus|XPHB]] for your Druid and Ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is [[Lightly Obscured|XPHB]], you can [[Hide|XPHB]] as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] even if you are being directly observed.
