## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If the assassin fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The assassin makes two Poison Blade attacks.

**Poison Blade.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) poison damage.



## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** When an attacker the assassin can see hits the assassin with an attack, the assassin halves the attack's damage against it.


## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Cunning.** The assassin escapes nonmagical restraints and ends the [[grappled]] condition on itself, then moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Stab (Costs 2 Actions).** The assassin makes one Poison Blade attack.

**Vanishing Escape (Costs 3 Actions).** The assassin creates a sudden distraction, such as a cloud of disorienting smoke or flash of dazzling light, filling a 10-foot cube within 5 feet of the assassin. Each creature of the assassin's choice in that area takes 9 (**2d8**) psychic damage, and the assassin has the [[invisible]] condition. This invisibility lasts until the end of the assassin's next turn.
