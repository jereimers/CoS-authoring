%% A session is a unit of play in which the players meet in person, enact one or more scenes/encounters, and then adjourn. Sessions have recaps and dates, and can span across boundaries of arc/act. %%

We pick up at the Blue Water Inn on the morning of Neyavr 4. Note that today is Arabelle's nameday.

# Erasmus' Plea

![[Arc H - The Lost Soul#H1. Erasmus' Plea]]

# Going to the Vistani camp

This begins when the players take the toy they purchased from Blinsky to the Vistani Camp, a half-hour's walk southwest of the village.

1. Read the description of the Vistani Camp ([[05_Chapter 5 - The Town of Vallaki#N9. Vistani Camp|WOTC]]) and offer them a choice -- up the hill, or speak to one fo the guards:

The woods part to reveal an expansive clearing: a small, grass-covered hill with low houses built into its sides. Fog obscures the details, but you can see that these buildings feature elegantly carved woodwork and have decorative lanterns hanging from their sculpted eaves. Atop the hill, above the fog, is a ring of barrel-topped wagons that surround a large tent with a column of smoke pouring out through a hole in the top. The tent is brightly lit from within. Even at this distance, you can smell the odors of wine and horses that emanate from this central area.

2. **If up the hill:** [[E2a - The Vistani Encampment]], read what's happening in the tent, and the players have a conversation with Luvash, and he asks them for help with the ring, and he sends them to Kasimir to retrieve it.
## Speaking with Luvash

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E2a. The Vistani Encampment]]

1. **Investigate the site of her disappearance?** if the party wants to track Arabelle from the site of her disappearance, allow them to do it but be mindful of the time of day. If it's nighttime, run a random encounter ([[02_Chapter 2 - The Lands of Barovia#Random Encounters]]) when they reach [[02_Chapter 2 - The Lands of Barovia#P. Luna River Crossroads|P. Luna River Crossroads]]
2. **If speak to guard:** They can direct the players up the hill (if they inquire about the Vistani) or to Kasimir's hovel. If Kasimir, they note that Kasimir has recently returned from a long and arduous journey and that the players must not disturb him beyond what is reasonably necessary.

## Speaking with Kasimir

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E2c. Kasimir’s Hovel]]

1. [[E2c - Kasimir’s Hovel]] - read the description! Then introduce Kasimir "sitting on the green rug facing the fire, meditating". He is a "mutilated, grief-stricken dusk elf"

<div class="description">
<p>
He is thin in the way of men who have survived history rather than lived through it. His dusky skin is ashen, drawn tight over sharp cheekbones, and his long, dark hair—once carefully kept—now hangs loose and is streaked with silver. His violet eyes are alert but hollow, fixed not quite on you, not quite on the present, as if he is listening to something beyond your perception.</p>
<p> His right hand and forearm are a pale bluish-white, with much of the skin puffy and blistered.
</div>

4. Kasimir can share some additional lore if asked: [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#^Info-What-Kasimir-Knows|What Kasimir Knows]]. He can also relate the full story of the dusk elves [[Kasimir's Tale]]
5. Don't forget to give them the ring! ![[signet-ring.png]]
# Searching the Burgomaster's Mansion

**The players' goal here is to search the library.** After a full hour searching, they won't find anything about the ring. But they will find something about Ireena's heritage...

There's a chance they'll split the party here: some search the library while others speak to [[Tereska]] about the ghost. Those who search the library will encounter Victor, eventually going with him to his study, where those who spoke with Tereska will join them with a plate of food from the kitchen.

## Searching the Library

[[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s desk contains three drawers stuffed with blank sheets of parchment, jars of ink, and writing quills. It also holds thick books of tax records dating back to the times of the baron's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.

Treasure. The Vallakovich book collection contains old, leather-bound tomes on virtually every subject. Use the Random Books table (see [[04_Chapter 4 - Castle Ravenloft#K37. Study]]) to determine the subject matter of a particular book.

7. In the library they'll meet [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] and see that his spellbook bears the same symbol as the signet ring. 

## Interviewing Tereska

The kitchen is largely as described in [[05_Chapter 5 - The Town of Vallaki#N3g. Kitchen|N3g. Kitchen]] (p. 106). The cook, [[Tereska]], is a broad-shouldered, rough-hewn woman with a tough, no-nonsense attitude who wears her heart on her sleeve. She is reluctant to discuss the spirit, but can share the following information if asked:

* The spirit has mostly been seen on the second floor, though strange sounds have been heard coming from the attic at night. 
* Tereska experienced one particularly bad haunting while retrieving an old pot from the attic last week—an eerie presence, coupled with a cold draft and the unmistakable sound of breathing—which nearly pushed her to quit her job.
* The Baroness’s lady-in-waiting, a quiet woman named Valentina, reported seeing the spirit in the Baroness’s mirror on multiple occasions. The Baroness hid the mirror away in the attic shortly thereafter.
* Valentina described the spirit’s appearance as the distorted silhouette of a young woman. All of the servants agree that its hauntings universally carry a sense of sorrow, loneliness, and longing.
* Few members of the household enter the attic anymore, though [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]]’s son, [[Victor Vallakovich]], has been known to disappear into it for hours or even days at a time. When he does, Tereska usually leaves his meals on a table by the entrance to the attic and knocks on the trapdoor to alert him. 
* If the players ask about Victor, Tereska notes that he eats too little and seems strangely isolated and terse for a young man his age, especially since the strange illness that struck “that Wachter girl” just over two months ago. (Tereska doesn’t remember her name, but knows that the girl was [[Lady Fiona Wachter]]’s daughter, and that she and Victor got along well.) Tereska declines to elaborate, insisting that [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]]’s family matters are none of her business.

If the players express an interest in investigating the attic, Tereska provides them with directions to the entrance in [[05_Chapter 5 - The Town of Vallaki#N3o. Master Bedroom|N3o. Master Bedroom]] (p. 108). She also prepares a small plate of bread and cheese, which she asks them to bring to Victor.
