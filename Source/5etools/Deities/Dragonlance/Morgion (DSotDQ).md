# Morgion

**Pantheon:** Dragonlance  
**Alignment:** Neutral Evil  
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** Hood with two red eyes

Solitary and secretive, Morgion is the god of disease and decay. He doesn't consult or act in accord with the other gods, preferring to brood in his otherworldly fortress, the Bronze Tower, and pursue his own schemes. His worshipers follow his example, meeting in the dark and maintaining secrecy in all things.
