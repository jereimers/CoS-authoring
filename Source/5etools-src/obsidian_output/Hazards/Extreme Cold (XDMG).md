# Extreme Cold

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level. Creatures that have [[Resistance|XPHB]] or [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save.
