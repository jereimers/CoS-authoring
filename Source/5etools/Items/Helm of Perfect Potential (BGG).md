# Helm of Perfect Potential

*Wondrous Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement)*

This copper-hued helm contains a shard of the Elemental Chaos embedded in its forehead, surrounded by a motif of a rising sun. Legend says Annam fashioned this helm for his daughter Diancastra to hold the fragment of chaos she used to prove her worth to her father.

## Random Properties

The helm has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- 2 [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] properties
- 1 [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property
- 1 [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property

## Master of Guile

While wearing the helm, you have advantage on Charisma ([[Deception]]) and Wisdom ([[Insight]]) checks.

## Arrow of Elemental Havoc

As a bonus action while wearing the helm, you can launch a bolt of searing elemental energy toward a creature you can see within 90 feet of yourself. The target must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes **4d6** acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

## Spellcasting

The helm has 6 charges and regains `1d6` charges each dawn. As an action while wearing the helm, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20): [[elemental weapon]] (1 charge), [[call lightning]] (2 charges), [[wall of fire]] (3 charges), [[conjure elemental]] (4 charges), [[tsunami]] (5 charges).
