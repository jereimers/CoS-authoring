# Ring of Djinni Summoning

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular [[djinni]] from the Elemental Plane of Air. The [[djinni]] appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if [[concentration]] on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.

While summoned, the [[djinni]] is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the [[djinni]] defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.

After the [[djinni]] departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the [[djinni]] dies.
