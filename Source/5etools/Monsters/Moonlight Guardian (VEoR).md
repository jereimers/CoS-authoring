## Traits

**Immutable Form.** The guardian is immune to any spell or other effect that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The guardian has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Radiant Absorption.** Whenever the guardian is subjected to radiant damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the radiant damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The guardian makes two Moonlight Slam attacks.

**Moonlight Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (**1d8**) radiant damage.

**Moonlight Blast {@recharge 5}.** The guardian unleashes a magical blast of moonlight in a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures that aren't in their true form have disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (**5d8**) radiant damage, and if it isn't in its true form, it is forced into its true form and can't change forms until the end of the guardian's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
