## Traits

**False Objects.** If the swarm is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the swarm move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check to discern that the swarm is animate.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a 1-foot-tall, 8-inch-wide, 2-inch-thick object. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Book Club.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. @h6 (**2d4 + 1**) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (**1d4 + 1**) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer.
