## Actions

**Multiattack.** The goose makes one Beak attack and two Wing attacks.

**Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Wing.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Thunderous Honk {@recharge 5}.** The goose honks with ear-splitting volume. Each other creature within 30 feet of the goose must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 16 (**3d10**) thunder damage and has the [[deafened]] condition until the start of the goose's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. The honk can be heard within 300 feet.
