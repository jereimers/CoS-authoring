You create a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of inky fog within range. The fog is magical [[Darkness|XPHB]] and lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by the [[Gust of Wind|XPHB]] spell) disperses it, ending the spell.

Each creature in the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] when it appears makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **5d6** Psychic damage and subtracts `1d6` from its saving throws until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] moves into its space, when it enters the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]], or when it ends its turn inside the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.

## Casting as a Circle Spell

Casting this as a Circle spell requires a minimum of five secondary casters. In addition to the spell's usual components, you must provide a special component (a string of three black pearls from Pandemonium), which the spell consumes. The spell's range increases to 1 mile, and its duration increases to until dispelled (no [[Concentration]] required). The spell ends early if any caster who participated in this casting contributes to another casting of [[Doomtide|FRHoF]] as a Circle spell.

When the spell is cast, each secondary caster must expend a level 3+ spell slot; otherwise, the spell fails.
