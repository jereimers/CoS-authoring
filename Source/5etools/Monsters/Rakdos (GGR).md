## Traits

**Captivating Presence.** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of Rakdos must make a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[charmed]] by Rakdos for 1 minute or until the creature is farther than 30 feet away from him. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to Rakdos's Captivating Presence for 24 hours.

**Cruel Entertainment.** When a creature Rakdos can see within 60 feet of him is reduced to 0 hit points, Rakdos gains 25 temporary hit points.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Rakdos fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Rakdos has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** Rakdos's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Rakdos makes two attacks with his Curtain-Call Scythe or his claws.

**Curtain-Call Scythe.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h24 (**3d10 + 8**) slashing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) fire damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d8 + 8**) slashing damage.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Sadistic Revelry.** Each creature within 60 feet of Rakdos that is his ally or is [[charmed]] by him must use its reaction to move up to half its speed toward the creature closest to it that it can see, provided it isn't already within 5 feet of that creature. It then must make one melee attack against that creature if it is able to do so.

**Scythe (Costs 2 Actions).** Rakdos uses Curtain-Call Scythe.

**Touch of Pain (Costs 3 Actions).** Rakdos makes a claw attack against one creature within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the creature can't maintain [[concentration]] on a spell or any other effect that requires [[concentration]]. The [[poisoned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
