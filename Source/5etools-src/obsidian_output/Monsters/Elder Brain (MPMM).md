## Traits

**Creature Sense.** The elder brain is aware of creatures within 5 miles of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each one's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a [[mind blank]] spell, a [[nondetection]] spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the elder brain fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The elder brain has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Telepathic Hub.** The elder brain can use its telepathy to initiate and maintain telepathic conversations with up to ten creatures at a time. The elder brain can let those creatures telepathically hear each other while connected in this way.


## Actions

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h20 (**4d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15) and takes 9 (**1d8 + 5**) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until the grapple ends. The elder brain can have up to four targets [[grappled]] at a time.

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** Creatures of the elder brain's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 32 (**5d10 + 5**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Bonus Actions

**Psychic Link.** The elder brain targets one [[incapacitated]] creature it senses with its Creature Sense trait and establishes a psychic link with the target. Until the link ends, the elder brain can perceive everything the target senses. The target becomes aware that something is linked to its mind once it is no longer [[incapacitated]], and the elder brain can terminate the link at any time (no action required). The target can use an action on its turn to attempt to break the link, doing so with a successful DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the target takes 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage. The link also ends if the target and the elder brain are more than 5 miles apart. The elder brain can form psychic links with up to ten creatures at a time.

**Sense Thoughts.** The elder brain targets a creature with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain gains insight into the target's emotional state and foremost thoughts (including worries, loves, and hates).



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Break Concentration.** The elder brain targets one creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain breaks the creature's [[concentration]] on a spell it has cast. The creature also takes 2 (**1d4**) psychic damage per level of the spell.

**Psychic Pulse.** The elder brain targets one creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The target and enemies of the elder brain within 30 feet of target take 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.

**Sever Psychic Link.** The elder brain targets one creature within 120 feet of it with which it has a psychic link. The elder brain ends the link, causing the creature to have disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the end of the creature's next turn.

**Tentacle (Costs 2 Actions).** The elder brain makes one Tentacle attack.
