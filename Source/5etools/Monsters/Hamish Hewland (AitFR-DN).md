**Axe.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Parry.** Hamish adds 2 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, he must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon or a shield.
