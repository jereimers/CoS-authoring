## Traits

**Evasion.** If Agdon is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if he fails, provided he isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Standing Leap.** Agdon's long jump is up to 20 feet and his high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Agdon makes two Branding Iron or Dagger attacks.

**Branding Iron.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d6**) fire damage, and the target is magically branded. Agdon is [[invisible]] to creatures branded in this way. The brand disappears after 24 hours, or it can be removed from a creature or object by any spell that ends a curse.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d4 + 5**) piercing damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Quick Fingers.** Agdon targets one creature within 5 feet of him that he can see and makes a Dexterity ([[Sleight of Hand]]) check, with a DC equal to 1 + the target's passive Wisdom ([[Perception]]) score. On a successful check, Agdon pilfers one object weighing 1 pound or less that the target has in its possession but not in its grasp, without the target noticing the theft.


## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** Agdon halves the damage that he takes from an attack that hits him. He must be able to see the attacker.
