## Traits

**Blurred Form.** Attack rolls against the spectral cloud are made with disadvantage unless the attacker is within 15 feet of the spectral cloud or the spectral cloud is [[incapacitated]].

**Incorporeal Movement.** The spectral cloud can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spectral cloud makes two Spectral Touch attacks.

**Spectral Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) force damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

A Humanoid slain by this attack immediately rises as a miniature spectral cloud (use the [[specter]] stat block in the Monster Manual). The miniature spectral cloud acts as an ally of its creator but isn't under its control.

**Chilling Winds {@recharge 5}.** The spectral cloud emits intensely cold wind in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (**7d10**) cold damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition for 1 minute. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, that creature is immune to this spectral cloud's Chilling Winds for the next 24 hours.
