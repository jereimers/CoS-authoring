## Traits

**Awakening of the Scion.** The cradle is a container for the [[scion of Surtur|BGG]]. When the cradle drops to 0 hit points, its body hardens and crumbles to ash. The scion instantly appears in the space the cradle occupied and uses the cradle's initiative count.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If the cradle fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The cradle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The cradle deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cradle makes three Slam or Hurl Lava attacks in any combination.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h31 (**4d10 + 9**) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (**4d6**) fire damage.

**Hurl Lava.** Ranged Weapon Attack +17 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h27 (**4d8 + 9**) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature within 5 feet of the fire takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 10 (**3d6**) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Erupting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The cradle exhales flames and volcanic gases in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (**10d10**) fire damage and has the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

A creature [[poisoned]] in this way can make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Bonus Actions

**Lava Geyser.** The cradle causes lava to erupt from a point on the ground it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius, 50-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) fire damage.
