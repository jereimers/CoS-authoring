## Traits

**Horrid Gnashing.** The nullifier's mouths gnash incoherently while it can see any enemies. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the nullifier and can hear it must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature rolls a `d8` to determine what it does during the current turn:

- **1-4::** The creature is [[stunned]] until the end of the turn.
- **5-6::** The creature is [[frightened]] until the end of the turn and uses its movement to get as far as possible from the nullifier.
- **7-8::** The creature doesn't move, and it uses its action to make one melee attack against a random creature (other than itself) if one is within reach. It otherwise does nothing

**Magic Resistance.** The nullifier has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nullifier makes three attacks: one with its bites and two with its claws.

**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h17 (**2d12 + 4**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) force damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) force damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16) if it's a creature. The nullifier has two claws, each of which can grapple one creature.



## Reactions

**Counterspell.** The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.
