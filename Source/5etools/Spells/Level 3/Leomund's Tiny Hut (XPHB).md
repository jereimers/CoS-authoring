A 10-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell fails when you cast it if the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] isn't big enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area.

Creatures and objects within the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] when you cast the spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can't be cast through it, and the effects of such spells can't extend into it.

The atmosphere inside the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to have [[Dim Light|XPHB]] or [[Darkness|XPHB]] (no action required). The [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is opaque from the outside and of any color you choose, but it's transparent from the inside.

The spell ends early if you leave the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or if you cast it again.
