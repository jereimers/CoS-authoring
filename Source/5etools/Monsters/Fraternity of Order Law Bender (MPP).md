## Actions

**Multiattack.** The law bender makes three Arcane Burst attacks and uses Power of Authority or Spellcasting.

**Arcane Burst.** Attack (ms,rs) +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 90 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d12 + 4**) force damage.

**Power of Authority.** The law bender targets a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage and have the [[incapacitated]] condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the [[incapacitated]] condition on itself on a success. A target that succeeds on the saving throw becomes immune to this law bender's Power of Authority for 24 hours.


## Bonus Actions

**Spatial Loophole.** The law bender teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.


## Reactions

**Probability Loophole (3/Day).** When the law bender or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the law bender can cause the roll to be made with advantage or disadvantage.
