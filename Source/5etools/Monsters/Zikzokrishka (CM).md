## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Zikzokrishka fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Zikzokrishka has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Zikzokrishka can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**2d10 + 7**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) lightning damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d6 + 7**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Zikzokrishka's choice that is within 120 feet of the Zikzokrishka and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Zikzokrishka's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Lightning Breath {@recharge 5}.** Zikzokrishka exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (**12d10**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Detect.** Zikzokrishka makes a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check.

**Tail Attack.** Zikzokrishka makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Zikzokrishka beats its tattered wings. Each creature within 10 feet of Zikzokrishka must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (**2d6 + 7**) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[prone]]. After beating its wings this way, Zikzokrishka can fly up to half its flying speed.
