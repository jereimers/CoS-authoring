# Dragonborn (Metallic)

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Metallic Ancestry

You have a metallic dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Metallic Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table.

**Metallic Ancestry**

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|---|---|
| Brass | Fire |
| Bronze | Lightning |
| Copper | Acid |
| Gold | Fire |
| Silver | Cold |

## Breath Weapon

When you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes **1d10** damage of the type associated with your Metallic Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by **1d10** when you reach 5th level (**2d10**), 11th level (**3d10**), and 17th level (**4d10**).

You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Draconic Resistance

You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Metallic Ancestry.

## Metallic Breath Weapon

At 5th level, you gain a second breath weapon. When you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. The save DC for this breath is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one:

- **Enervating Breath:** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [[incapacitated]] until the start of your next turn.
- **Repulsion Breath:** Each creature in the cone must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from you and be knocked [[prone]].

Once you use your Metallic Breath Weapon, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
