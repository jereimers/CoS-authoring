## Bonus Actions

**Fey Leap.** The dolphin teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Immediately before teleporting, the dolphin can choose one creature within 5 feet of it. That creature can teleport with the dolphin, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the dolphin's destination space.
