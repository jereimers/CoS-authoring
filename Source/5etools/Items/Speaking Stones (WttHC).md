# Speaking Stones

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

Speaking Stones come in pairs, with each stone carved to match the other.

While you touch one stone, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to send a short message of 25 words or fewer to the bearer of the other stone. That creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The stones enable creatures to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance. If no creature bears the other stone, you know that fact as soon as you use the stone, and you don't send the message.

Once either stone is used to send a message in this way, the stones can't be used again until the next dawn. If one of the stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes nonmagical.
