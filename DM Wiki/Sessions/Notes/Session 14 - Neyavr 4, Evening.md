%% A session is a unit of play in which the players meet in person, enact one or more scenes/encounters, and then adjourn. Sessions have recaps and dates, and can span across boundaries of arc/act. %%

We pick up at Wachterhaus, as dinner with Lady Fiona is about to begin.

>[!note]+ SESSION NOTE
>Since we'll be playing at the bar, I expect the Dinner to take the majority of our time. A fine place to end would be at **The Players Return**, below, when they discover the Blue Water Inn was ransacked. If we reach this point earlier than expected, it's fine to continue into Neyavr 5 with the 3 Options detailed later in this document.

# Neyavr 4, Dinnertime
## Dinner at [[Wachterhaus]]

![[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish#^Profile-Lady-Fiona-Wachter]]
### Drinks in the Parlor

>[!tldr]+ Things Fiona can say to the players
>***Arden:*** Your armor is magnificent, though I'm afraid I don't recognize the sigil on your breastplate... what meaning does it hold?
>
>***Fig:*** I can't say I've ever seen a blade such as that! Where did you acquire such a marvelous instrument? (Can also inquire about the silver dragon pendant)
>
>***Choppy:*** Aren't you a charming young man! However did you come to wield such powerful magics? And wherever did you learn such impeccable manners?
>
>***Varnish:*** I find your manner of dress fascinating, Mr. Gothorn, especially those shaded spectacles. Have they served you well here in our shadowed land? And that instrument is unfamiliar to me, but I can sense its importance—it's an instrument of more than merely music, is it not?

## Return to the [[Blue Water Inn]]

> [!note]+ DM NOTE
>
>Izek has only seen Ireena in the context of the party (never by herself). The party was known to be aiding Father Lucian after the church was damaged, so it wouldn't be weird for them to be repeatedly visiting the church. They are also know to be staying at the Blue Water Inn, so it's fair to say that Izek assumed Ireena would be staying at the inn along with the party (and not at the church, which is obviously not a place at which most people would take up temporary residence). His INT and WIS are also super low (10 and 9, respectively) so he couldn't have thought that hard about it.
