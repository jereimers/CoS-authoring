# Keoghtom's Ointment

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains `1d4 + 1` doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can swallow one dose of the ointment or apply it to a creature within 5 feet of yourself. The creature that receives it regains `2d8 + 2` [[Hit Points|XPHB]] and ceases to have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition.
