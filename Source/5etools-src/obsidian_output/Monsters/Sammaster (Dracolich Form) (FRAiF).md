## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Sammaster fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Life Suppression.** Creatures within 60 feet of Sammaster can't regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]].

**Magic Resistance.** Sammaster has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Soul Gem.** Sammaster has a magical soul gem as his dracolich heart. The gem can't be damaged or removed until he is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. If Sammaster is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], his dracolich form dissolves to dust. After `1d10` days, he appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of his soul gem (so long as the gem still exists), using the Sammaster (Lich Form) stat block. The gem is a Tiny object that has AC 20; HP 50; and [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Acid, Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage. The gem regains all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] at the end of every turn, but it turns to dust if reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].
