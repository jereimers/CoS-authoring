## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the trapper is motionless on a floor, wall, or ceiling at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the trapper move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the trapper isn't part of the floor, wall, or ceiling.

**Spider Climb.** The trapper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Smother.** One Large or smaller creature within 10 feet of the trapper must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [[grappled]] (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 13 (**3d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (**1d6**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. While [[grappled]] in this way, the target is [[restrained]], [[blinded]], and deprived of air. The trapper can smother only one creature at a time.
