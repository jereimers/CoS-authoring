## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Mercion wields a [[+1 quarterstaff]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Mercion makes one Divine Radiance attack and one +1 Quarterstaff attack. She can replace one of these attacks with a use of Spellcasting.

**Divine Radiance.** Attack (ms,rs) +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d8**) radiant damage.

**+1 Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage, or 7 (**1d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands.

**Radiant Fire {@recharge 5}.** Mercion creates a magical explosion of fiery radiance centered on a point she can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (**8d6**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
