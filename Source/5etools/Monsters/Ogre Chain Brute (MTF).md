## Actions

**Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.

**Chain Sweep.** The ogre swings its chain, and every creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8 (**1d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[prone]]. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].

**Chain Smash {@recharge}.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the target is [[unconscious]] for 1 minute. The [[unconscious]] target repeats the saving throw if it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
