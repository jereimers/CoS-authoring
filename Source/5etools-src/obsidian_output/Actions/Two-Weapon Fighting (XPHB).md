# Two-Weapon Fighting

**Time:** 1 bonus

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a [[Shortsword|XPHB]] in one hand and a [[Dagger|XPHB]] in the other using the [[Attack|XPHB]] action and a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] unless that modifier is negative.
