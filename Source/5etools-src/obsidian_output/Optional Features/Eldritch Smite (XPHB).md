# Eldritch Smite

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to deal an extra **1d8** Force damage to the target, plus another `1d8` per level of the spell slot, and you can give the target the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition if it is Huge or smaller.
