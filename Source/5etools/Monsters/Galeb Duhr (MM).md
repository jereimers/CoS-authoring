## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the galeb duhr remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal boulder.

**Rolling Charge.** If the galeb duhr rolls at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (**2d6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].


## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Animate Boulders (1/Day).** The galeb duhr magically animates up to two boulders it can see within 60 feet of it. A boulder has statistics like those of a galeb duhr, except it has Intelligence 1 and Charisma 1, it can't be [[charmed]] or [[frightened]], and it lacks this action option. A boulder remains animated as long as the galeb duhr maintains [[concentration]], up to 1 minute (as if [[concentration]] on a spell).
