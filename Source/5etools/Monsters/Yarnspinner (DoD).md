## Traits

**Fey Rebirth.** If Yarnspinner dies in his Domain of Delight, he revives with all his hit points `1d4` days later in a safe location in that domain.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Yarnspinner fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Spider Climb.** Yarnspinner can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Walker.** Yarnspinner ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

**Web Weaver (3/Day).** Yarnspinner can take 1 minute to craft one of the following structures out of webbing:

- A 3-inch-thick, opaque wall of webbing consisting of up to three 10-foot-square sections, each of which must be anchored on at least two sides by other walls or surfaces. Each section has AC 12; 20 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.
- A hut small enough to fit in a 10-foot cube. The hut comes with a closable door and a comfortable bed made of webbing, sized for a Tiny, Small, or Medium creature.
- A message consisting of no more than twenty-five characters, anchored at various points so it hangs in the air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Yarnspinner makes two Bite attacks and uses Spellcasting or Web once.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d6 + 7**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) poison damage.

**Web.** Yarnspinner shoots webbing at one creature he can see within 120 feet of himself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be [[restrained]] for 1 hour. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
