## Traits

**Amphibious.** The crab can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The crab makes two Claw attacks and one Stinger attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16). The crab has four claws, each of which can grapple one target.

**Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] and [[paralyzed]] conditions for 1 minute. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending both the [[poisoned]] and [[paralyzed]] conditions on itself on a success.

**Water Jet {@recharge 5}.** The crab exhales water in a 150-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (**6d8**) bludgeoning damage, is pushed up to 30 feet from the crab, and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
