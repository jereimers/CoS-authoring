## Traits

**Fallible Invisibility.** The skulk is [[invisible]]. This invisibility can be circumvented by three things:

- **Charnel Candles:** The skulk appears as a dim, translucent form in the light of a candle made of fat rendered from a corpse whose identity is unknown.
- **Children:** Humanoid children, aged 10 and under, can see through this invisibility.
- **Reflective Surfaces:** The skulk appears as a drab, smooth-skinned biped if its reflection can be seen in a mirror or on another surface.

**Trackless.** The skulk leaves no tracks to indicate where it has been or where it's headed.


## Actions

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) slashing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) necrotic damage.
