## Actions

**Sting.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.
