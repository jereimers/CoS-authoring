# Storm of Vengeance

*9th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 1 miles  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

A churning storm cloud forms for the duration, centered on a point within range and spreading to a radius of 300 feet. Each creature under the cloud when it appears must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take **2d6** Thunder damage and have the [[Deafened|XPHB]] condition for the duration.

At the start of each of your later turns, the storm produces different effects, as detailed below.

## Turn 2

Acidic rain falls. Each creature and object under the cloud takes **4d6** Acid damage.

## Turn 3

You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six different creatures or objects beneath it. Each target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **10d6** Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Turn 4

Hailstones rain down. Each creature under the cloud takes **2d6** Bludgeoning damage.

## Turns 5-10

Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. Each creature there takes **1d6** Cold damage. Until the spell ends, the area is [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]] and [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]], ranged attacks with weapons are impossible there, and strong wind blows through the area.
