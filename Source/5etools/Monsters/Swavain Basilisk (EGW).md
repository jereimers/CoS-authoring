## Traits

**Amphibious.** The basilisk can breathe air and water.

**Petrifying Secretions.** A creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw if it hits the basilisk with a weapon attack while within 5 feet of it or if it starts its turn [[grappled]] by the basilisk. Unless the save succeeds, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [[restrained]], and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [[petrified]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The basilisk makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) poison damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 12).
