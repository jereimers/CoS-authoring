# Siren

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** walk 25 ft., fly 30 ft.  
**Ability Score Increase:** CHA +2

## Alignment

Most sirens lean toward chaotic alignment, cherishing the freedom and independence that comes from joining a pirate crew.

## Size

Sirens stand about 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

## Siren's Song

You know the [[friends]] cantrip and can cast it without material components.

## Flight

You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for [[encumbrance|PHB]], you can't use your flying speed if you are encumbered.)

## Languages

You can speak, read, and write [[Common Trade Pidgin|PSX]] (if it exists in your campaign) and [[Siren|PSX]].
