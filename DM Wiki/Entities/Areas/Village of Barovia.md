# Overview

The [[Village of Barovia]] is a gloomy, heavily fortified settlement ravaged by death and despair. The structures bear scorch marks, gashes, and several buildings show partially collapsed roofs or walls, with cold, creeping fog drifting through broken windows. Wooden barricades stand haphazardly along the streets, composed of logs, planks, and broken furniture. A trench has been dug around the village and planted with sharp stakes, with archers patrolling the rooftops at all hours.

The village is gripped by fear and exhaustion following a devastating siege by undead forces. More than a dozen makeshift tents and campfires have been established around the town square, housing the elderly, sick, and children as a fortification of last resort. An eerie silence descends at night, and the faint scent of decay and rot permeates the air.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]] and [[Arc C - Into the Valley]], the party learned:

## The Siege

**Timeline and Events:**
- Approximately 90 days before the party's arrival, [[Doru]] (the priest's son) led a rebellion against [[Castle Ravenloft]] with the help of the legendary vampire hunter [[Rudolph van Richten|Dr. Rudolph van Richten]] (disguised as "Alanik Ray")
- The rebellion failed and awakened [[Source/CoS-Reloaded/Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] from 100 years of dormancy
- [[Rahadin]], Strahd's chamberlain, came to the village with a proclamation: they had 90 days to make peace with the gods before facing Strahd's vengeance
- Six nights before the party arrived, the siege began—undead forces attacked nightly in waves
- Strahd personally invaded the burgomaster's mansion, killing [[Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] and biting [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
- After the party helped defend the village, Strahd formally withdrew the horde

**Casualties:**
- Dozens of Barovians confirmed dead
- Several dozen villagers fled to [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] before the siege began
- [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] lost his sister Marta, her husband Dragomir, and many friends
- Their son [[Parriwimple]] is now an orphan
- The Lansten family (two parents, three children) went missing during the zombie attack
- Many others lost loved ones and homes

## The Situation

- The village is cut off from the world: the Mists block passage to the east, and undead infest the woods on all other sides
- Hundreds of undead lurk in the surrounding forests—perhaps as many as a thousand
- Strahd's spies are everywhere: wolves, bats, and animated vegetation watch the village
- [[Doru]] returned as a vampire spawn, now trapped in the church undercroft by his father
- The village is divided—some blame [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] for the casualties, calling him "Ismark the Lesser" in mockery of his legendary ancestor

## Atmosphere

Haggard villagers with haunted eyes display visible signs of trauma—clothes stained with mud or blood, their hands never far from weapons. The mood is one of despair and resignation, with survivors exhausted from defending against nightly attacks. The persistent fog creeps through the streets, and decay permeates the air.

# Notable Places
