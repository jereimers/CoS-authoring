# Feather Fall

*1st-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction (which you take when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you falls)  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, M (a small feather or piece of down)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

---

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If a creature lands before the spell ends, the creature takes no damage from the fall, and the spell ends for that creature.
