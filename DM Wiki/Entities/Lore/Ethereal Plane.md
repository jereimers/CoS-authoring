# What It Is

The Ethereal Plane is a ghostly realm that exists parallel to the material world. It is a misty, fog-bound dimension where spirits, ghosts, and certain creatures dwell.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Victor Vallakovich]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

- The Ethereal Plane is a separate dimension that exists alongside the material world
- [[Stella Wachter]]'s soul became trapped in the Ethereal Plane when a teleportation circle experiment failed catastrophically
- In the Ethereal Plane, Stella was attacked by a "gallows speaker"—a dark shadow entity that feeds on souls
- [[Erasmus|Erasmus]] van Richten's ghost exists in the Ethereal Plane and has been protecting Stella's soul from the shadows
- Stella's soul is slowly fading in the Ethereal Plane; she sometimes can't remember who she is and experiences strange sensations
- A ritual from [[Khazan]]'s books can temporarily transport living creatures into the Ethereal Plane for up to one hour
- The ritual requires a [[Night Hags|night hag]]'s [[Heartstone|heartstone]] to function
- [[Night Hags|Night hags]] naturally travel between the material world and the Ethereal Plane to prey on sleeping victims

# Properties

Based on what Victor has shared:

- The Ethereal Plane is separate from the material world but connected to it
- Ghosts and certain undead can exist in the Ethereal Plane
- Souls can become trapped there under catastrophic magical circumstances
- Time appears to function differently—Stella has survived for two months when she should have faded in hours
- Dark entities inhabit the Ethereal Plane and prey on trapped souls

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Victor's Workroom|Session 13]] — [[Victor Vallakovich]] explained the Ethereal Plane and [[Stella Wachter]]'s predicament; revealed the plan to enter the Ethereal Plane to rescue her soul
