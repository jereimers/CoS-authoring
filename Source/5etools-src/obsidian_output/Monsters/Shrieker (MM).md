## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the shrieker remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary fungus.




## Reactions

**Shriek.** When bright light or a creature is within 30 feet of the shrieker, it emits a shriek audible within 300 feet of it. The shrieker continues to shriek until the disturbance moves out of range and for `1d4` of the shrieker's turns afterward.
