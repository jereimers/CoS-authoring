## Actions

**Shocking Grasp (Cantrip).** Melee Spell Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature (the attack roll has advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal). @h9 (**2d8**) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Acid Splash (Cantrip).** The simulacrum hurls a bubble of acid at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it, or at two such creatures that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) acid damage.

**Magic Missile (1st-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).** The simulacrum creates three darts of magical force. Each dart unerringly strikes one creature the simulacrum can see within 120 feet of it, dealing 3 (**1d4 + 1**) force damage. If the simulacrum casts this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, it creates one more dart.
