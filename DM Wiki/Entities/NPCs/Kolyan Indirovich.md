# Who they ~~are~~ were

Former burgomaster of the [[Village of Barovia]], grandson of Ismark Antonovich the Great, and father to [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]]. 

# What the party knows

- He was the one who found Ireena when she was a young girl, by the edge of the [[Svalich Woods]] near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. 

# Personality

- You never met him, but he was apparently a steely, strong-willed, yet compassionate leader respected by all in the village.

# Where we've seen them

- He wrote and sent [[Kolyan's Letter]], which you found on the corpse of Dalvan Olensky in [[Session 01 - Arrivals]]
- Y'all helped bury his body in [[Session 03 - Kolyan's Burial#Burying Kolyan|Session 3]]
