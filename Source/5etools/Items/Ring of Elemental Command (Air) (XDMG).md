# Ring of Elemental Command (Air)

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

The Ring of Elemental Command (air) is linked to the Elemental Plane of Air. Every Ring of Elemental Command has the following two properties:

- **Elemental Bane:** While wearing the ring, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against Elementals and they have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against you.
- **Elemental Compulsion:** While wearing the ring, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.

## Elemental Focus

While wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring's linked Elemental Plane:

- **Air:** You know Auran, you have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Lightning damage, and you have a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] equal to your [[Speed|XPHB]] and can hover.

## Spellcasting

The ring has 5 charges and regains `1d4 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. A spell cast from the ring has a save DC of 18. Choose the spell from the following list: [[Chain Lightning|XPHB]] (3 charges), [[Feather Fall|XPHB]] (0 charges), [[Gust of Wind|XPHB]] (2 charges), [[Wind Wall|XPHB]] (1 charge)
