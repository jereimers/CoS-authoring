## Traits

**Electrified Body.** Any creature that touches the hybrid or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (**1d10**) lightning damage.

**Illumination.** The hybrid sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hybrid makes two attacks: one with its shocking touch and one with its tentacles.

**Shocking Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d8**) lightning damage.

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. @hThe target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 11), and the hybrid pulls the target up to 15 feet straight toward it. Until this grapple ends, the target takes 5 (**1d10**) lightning damage at the start of each of its turns, and the hybrid shocker can't use its tentacles on another creature.
