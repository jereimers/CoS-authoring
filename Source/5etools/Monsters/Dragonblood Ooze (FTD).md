## Traits

**Amorphous.** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Spider Climb.** The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The ooze makes two Pseudopod attacks. The ooze can replace one Pseudopod attack with its Slime Breath, if available.

**Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (**4d6**) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target takes 7 (**2d6**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Slime Breath {@recharge}.** The ooze expels a spray of its gelatinous mass in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (**4d10**) acid damage and is pulled up to 30 feet straight toward the ooze. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.
