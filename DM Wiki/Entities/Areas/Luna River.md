# What It Is

The Luna River flows west of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], eventually feeding into [[Lake Zarovich]]. A clearing along its banks became the site of [[Arabelle]]'s abduction.

# What the Party Knows

The party visited the Luna River in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]] to investigate [[Arabelle]]'s disappearance:

## Approaching the Site

- The party crossed an old wooden bridge spanning the rushing waters of the Luna River
- The age-worn planks groaned under their weight
- Halfway across, [[Fig Fleetfoot|Fig]] spotted a white handkerchief monogrammed with "R.V.R." caught on a tree root downstream
- The river tumbles over smooth stones, bordered by gnarled bushes and trees

## The Riverside Clearing

This clearing is where [[Yan]] was killed and [[Arabelle]] was abducted:

- [[Savid]], a dusk elf guard, discovered [[Yan]]'s decapitated body here three days prior
- The clearing showed clear signs of a violent struggle
- Trampled grass and disturbed earth marked the site of combat
- [[Yan]]'s headless corpse was already beginning to decay when the party arrived

## Evidence Found

[[Fig Fleetfoot|Fig]]'s investigation revealed:

**Three Sets of Footprints in the Muddy Ground:**
1. First set: came from the north, ended abruptly in the grass (Yan's - he died here)
2. Second set: came from the north, continued southwest to a tree trunk 30 feet away, then went UP into the canopy (someone fled by climbing)
3. Third set: emerged from the western woods, showed signs of fighting with the first, then led toward the riverbank carrying something heavy and child-sized (the abductor)

**Physical Clues:**
- A torn shred of expensive silk fabric caught on a tree branch 20 feet up (where the second person fled)
- The silk carried faint undead energy (detected by [[Arden Nalero|Arden]]'s divine senses)
- A platinum signet ring bearing [[Khazan]]'s sigil, dropped during the struggle (now with the party)

**The Party's Conclusion:**
The evidence pointed to [[Escher]], [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s vampire spawn, as the one who carried Arabelle away into the river. The person who fled into the trees remains unidentified (though the "R.V.R." handkerchief found upstream may be connected).

# Location

- West of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], accessible via the [[Old Svalich Road]]
- South of the [[Luna River Crossroads]] (where the party fought [[Twig Blights|twig blights]] and [[Scarecrows|scarecrows]])
- The clearing is reached by following directions from [[Luvash]] at the [[Vistani Camp]]

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#CSI Luna River|Session 13]] — The party investigated the riverside clearing where [[Yan]] was killed and [[Arabelle]] was abducted
