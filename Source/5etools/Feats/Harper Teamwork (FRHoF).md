# Harper Teamwork

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Withering Wordplay

When you take the [[Help|XPHB]] action to assist an ally's attack roll against an enemy, that enemy also has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on the first saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

## Inspiring Willpower

If you succeed on a saving throw to end the [[Frightened|XPHB]] or [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition on yourself, you can choose one ally you can see within 30 feet of yourself that has the same condition. That condition immediately ends for that ally.
