## Traits

**Voice from the Past (1/Day).** The professor can cast the [[contact other plane]] spell to contact a long-dead spirit, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The professor makes two Repelling Burst attacks. It can also use Force Barrier, if available.

**Repelling Burst.** Melee Spell Attack +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) force damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from the professor and become [[restrained]] until the start of professor's next turn.

**Force Barrier {@recharge 5}.** The professor magically creates a wall of translucent, golden force within 90 feet of itself. The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the professor uses this action again. The barrier can be a vertical or horizontal plane up to 30 feet on a side or a 10-foot-radius hemispherical dome with a floor. The wall provides Cover. It has AC 17, 30 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.



## Reactions

**Arcane Stasis (2/Day).** When a creature the professor can see within 60 feet of it casts a spell, the professor can magically lock the casting in the moment before completion. The spellcaster must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw using the spell's spellcasting ability, or the spell fails and is wasted.
