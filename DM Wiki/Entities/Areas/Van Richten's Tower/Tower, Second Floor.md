# V5. Tower, Second Floor

Dust and cobwebs fill this otherwise empty room, the wooden floor of which is badly rotted and partially collapsed.

In the middle of the room is a 5 -foot-square hole in the floor and ceiling, with a rusty chain near each corner. The chains are part of the tower's elevator mechanism (see area V4). The 5 -foot-square sections of floor that surround the central shaft are weak. Each 5 -foot section can support 150 pounds; any more weight causes the section to collapse, and any creatures standing on that section fall 20 feet to the ground floor.
