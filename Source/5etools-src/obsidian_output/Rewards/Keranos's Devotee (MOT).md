# Keranos's Devotee

*Piety Trait*

*Piety 3+ Keranos trait*

As a devotee of Keranos, you have proven your wisdom and your allegiance to the storm lord. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra **1d6** lightning damage to the target. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
