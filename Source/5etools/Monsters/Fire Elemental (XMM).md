## Traits

**Fire Aura.** At the end of each of the elemental's turns, each creature in a 10-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the elemental takes 5 (**1d10**) Fire damage. Creatures and flammable objects in the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] start [[burning|XPHB]].

**Fire Form.** The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so, and it can enter a creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (**1d10**) Fire damage.

**Illumination.** The elemental sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 30 feet.

**Water Susceptibility.** The elemental takes 3 (**1d6**) Cold damage for every 5 feet the elemental moves in water or for every gallon of water splashed on it.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two Burn attacks.

**Burn.** m +6, reach 5 ft. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) Fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it starts [[burning|XPHB]].
