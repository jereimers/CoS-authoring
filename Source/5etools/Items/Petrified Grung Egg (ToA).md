# Petrified Grung Egg

*Item, Unknown (Magic)* *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

While this egg is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you have used the egg, it can't be used again until the next dawn.

Additionally, while you are attuned to the egg, you gain resistance to poison damage.

The egg turns to dust and is destroyed if it leaves the Tomb of the Nine Gods.
