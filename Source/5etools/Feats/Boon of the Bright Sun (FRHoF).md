# Boon of the Bright Sun

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Daylight Presence

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you radiate a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of [[Bright Light|XPHB]] that is sunlight. If any of the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]'s area overlaps with an area of [[Darkness|XPHB]] created by a spell, that spell is dispelled. The [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] lasts until you dismiss it (no action required), die, or have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.

## Fortifying Light

When your Daylight Presence is active, at the start of each of your turns, you and allies you can see in your Daylight Presence gain 10 [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]].
