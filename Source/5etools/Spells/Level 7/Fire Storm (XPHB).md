A storm of fire appears within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot Cubes, which you arrange as you like. Each [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] must be contiguous with at least one other [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **7d10** Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start [[burning|XPHB]].
