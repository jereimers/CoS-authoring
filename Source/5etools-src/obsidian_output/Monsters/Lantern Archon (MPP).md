## Traits

**Aura of Menace.** As long as the archon doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition, each creature of the archon's choice that starts its turn within 20 feet of the archon must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[frightened]] condition until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to all archons' Aura of Menace for 24 hours.

**Illumination.** The archon sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

**Incorporeal Movement.** The archon can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If it ends its turn inside an object, it takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The archon makes two Radiant Strike attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Teleport.

**Radiant Strike.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) radiant damage.

**Teleport.** The archon teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 120 feet of itself.


## Bonus Actions

**Shift Radiance.** The archon reduces its Illumination to shed only dim light in a 5-foot radius, or it returns the light to full intensity.
