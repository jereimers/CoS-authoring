## Traits

**Detect Invisibility.** The King of Feathers can see [[invisible]] creatures and objects as if they were visible.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the King of Feathers fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The King of Feathers makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h33 (**4d12 + 7**) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the tyrannosaurus can't bite another target.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.

**Summon Swarm {@recharge 5}.** The King of Feathers exhales a [[swarm of wasps|]] that forms in a space within 20 feet of it. The swarm acts as an ally of the King of Feathers and takes its turn immediately after it. The swarm disperses after 1 minute. It can't use the Summon Swarm action while it is grappling a creature with its jaws.
