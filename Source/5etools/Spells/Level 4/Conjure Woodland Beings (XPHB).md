You conjure nature spirits that flit around you in a 10-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] for the duration. Whenever the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes **5d8** Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

In addition, you can take the [[Disengage|XPHB]] action as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] for the spell's duration.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `5d8` for each spell slot level above 4.
