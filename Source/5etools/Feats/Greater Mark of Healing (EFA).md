# Greater Mark of Healing

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Improved Intuition

When you use the Medical Intuition benefit of your [[Mark of Healing|EFA]] feat, you can roll `1d6` instead of `1d4`.

## Improved Healing

You can now use the Healing Touch benefit of your [[Mark of Healing|EFA]] feat to cast [[Cure Wounds|XPHB]] without using a spell slot a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. Additionally, when you cast [[Cure Wounds|XPHB]] and roll dice to determine the number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] restored, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a roll as a 3.
