# Description
A player seeking **redemption** begins the campaign with the *angel's feather*, a large, snow-white feather. When viewed beneath the light of the morning sun, the feather's barbs glimmer like gold.

The player who possesses the *angel's feather* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will one day lead them to redemption for the sins that they have committed.

***Developments.*** When the players first arrive at the Abbey in [[Arc I - The Walls of Krezk]] or [[Arc K - The Fallen Abbey]] the *angel's feather* glimmers and is swept away in the same way that it did upon sensing [[Haunted House|Death House]], guiding the player toward [[The Abbot|the Abbot]]. [[The Abbot]] recognizes the feather as his own, but dismisses its importance.

Unbeknownst to the player, the *angel's feather* formerly belonged to [[The Abbot|Ithuriel]], a **deva** that serves the god [[The Morninglord|Lathander]], who is known to his followers as [[The Morninglord]]. Ithuriel is the true name of [[The Abbot]], who dwells in the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] in Barovia. When it senses the presence of [[Haunted House|Death House]], the feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.
