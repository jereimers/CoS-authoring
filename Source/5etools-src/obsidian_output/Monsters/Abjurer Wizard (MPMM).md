## Actions

**Multiattack.** The abjurer makes three Arcane Burst attacks.

**Arcane Burst.** Attack (ms,rs) +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d10 + 4**) force damage.

**Force Blast.** Each creature in a 20-foot cube originating from the abjurer must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (**8d8**) force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the abjurer. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.



## Reactions

**Arcane Ward {@recharge 4}.** When the abjurer or a creature it can see within 30 feet of it takes damage, the abjurer magically creates a protective barrier around itself or the other creature. The barrier reduces the damage to the protected creature by 26 (**4d10 + 4**), to a minimum of 0, and then vanishes.
