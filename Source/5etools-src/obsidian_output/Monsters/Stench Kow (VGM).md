## Traits

**Charge.** If the kow moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (**2d6**) piercing damage.

**Stench.** Any creature other than a stench kow that starts its turn within 5 feet of the stench kow must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all stench kows for 1 hour.


## Actions

**Gore.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage.
