## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Klauth fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Dual Wand Wielder.** If Klauth is carrying two wands, he can use an action to expend 1 charge from each wand, triggering the effects of both wands simultaneously.

**Special Equipment.** Klauth carries a [[wand of fireballs]] and a [[wand of lightning bolts]], and he wears a [[ring of cold resistance]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Klauth can use his Frightful Presence. He then makes three attacks: one with his bite and two with his claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h21 (**2d10 + 10**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) fire damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d6 + 10**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d8 + 10**) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Klauth's choice that is within 120 feet of Klauth and aware of him must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Klauth's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Fire Breath {@recharge 5}.** Klauth exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (**26d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Detect.** Klauth makes a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check.

**Tail Attack.** Klauth makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Klauth beats his wings. Each creature within 15 feet of Klauth must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (**2d6 + 10**) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[prone]]. Klauth can then fly up to half his flying speed.
