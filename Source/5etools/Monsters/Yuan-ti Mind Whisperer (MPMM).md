## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the yuan-ti's [[darkvision]].

**Magic Resistance.** The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sseth's Blessing.** When the yuan-ti reduces an enemy to 0 hit points, the yuan-ti gains 9 temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The yuan-ti makes two Bite attacks and one Scimitar attack, or it makes two Spectral Fangs attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) poison damage.

**Scimitar (Yuan-ti Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.
