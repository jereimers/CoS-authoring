# Staff of Flowers

*Item, Common*

This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of yourself, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.
