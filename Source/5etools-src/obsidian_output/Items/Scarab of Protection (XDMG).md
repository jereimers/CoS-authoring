# Scarab of Protection

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

This beetle-shaped medallion provides three benefits while it is on your person.

## Defense

You gain a +1 bonus to [[Armor Class|XPHB]].

## Preservation

The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

## Spell Resistance

You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells.
