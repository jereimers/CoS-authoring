When the abjurer casts an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell.


## Actions

**Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h2 (**1d6 - 1**) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (**1d8 - 1**) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
