## Traits

**Incorporeal Movement.** The specter can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the specter has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Life Drain.** Melee Spell Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
