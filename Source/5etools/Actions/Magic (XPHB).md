# Magic

**Time:** 1 action

When you take the Magic action, you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action or use a feature or magic item that requires a Magic action to be activated.

If you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 minute or longer, you must take the Magic action on each turn of that casting, and you must maintain [[Concentration]] while you do so. If your [[Concentration]] is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot.
