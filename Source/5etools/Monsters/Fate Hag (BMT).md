## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If the hag fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Trace the Threads (1/Day).** The hag can cast the [[Legend Lore]] spell, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hag makes two Shears attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Shears.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) force damage. If the target is a creature, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the hag's next turn.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Destined Jaunt.** The hag magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of itself.

**Tangle Threads.** The hag magically tangles a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself in spectral silver threads. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw, or its speed is reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn.

**Destiny Curse (Costs 2 Actions).** The hag magically curses a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The creature must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, and the creature has disadvantage on this save if it has damaged the hag within the last minute. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the curse ends. Once per turn, when the cursed creature fails one of those `d20` rolls, it takes 7 (**2d6**) force damage. The curse ends after 1 minute; when the creature succeeds on a total of three ability checks, attack rolls, or saving throws in any combination; or when the hag uses this action again.
