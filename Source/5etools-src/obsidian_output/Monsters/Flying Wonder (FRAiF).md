## Traits

**Increased Carrying Capacity.** The wonder can carry up to 100 pounds.

**Wind-Up Operation.** The wonder has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition until another creature winds it with the wonder's unique key for 1 minute. Once wound, the wonder operates for 24 hours or until a creature touches the wonder with its key as a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action to deactivate it, after which the wonder has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition until it is wound again.



## Bonus Actions

**Chime.** The wonder chirps a merry, metronomic tune. The wonder chooses one ally that it can see within 60 feet. Until the start of the wonder's next turn, the target has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on the next ability check it makes with a Musical Instrument or Tinker's Tools.

**Sprint.** The wonder takes the Dash action.
