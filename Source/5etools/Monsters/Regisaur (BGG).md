## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The regisaur has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The regisaur makes one Bite attack and one Tail attack. The regisaur can't target the same creature with both attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h47 (**6d12 + 8**) piercing damage, and the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition, and the regisaur can't Bite another target.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h26 (**4d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Swallow.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Huge or smaller creature [[grappled]] by the regisaur. @hThe regisaur swallows the target, and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature has the [[blinded]] and [[restrained]] conditions, it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the regisaur, and it takes 7 (**2d6**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The regisaur can have up to two creatures swallowed at a time.

If the regisaur takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the regisaur must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls in a space within 5 feet of the regisaur and has the [[prone]] condition; the creature no longer has the [[blinded]] and [[restrained]] conditions.
