## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the abishai's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance.** The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The abishai can use its Frightful Presence. It also makes three attacks: one with its morningstar, one with its claw, and one with its bite.

**Morningstar.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 38 (**7d10**) fire damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the abishai's choice that is within 120 feet and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the abishai's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Incite Fanaticism.** The abishai chooses up to four of its allies within 60 feet of it that can see it. For 1 minute, each of those allies makes attack rolls with advantage and can't be [[frightened]].

**Power of the Dragon Queen.** The abishai targets one dragon it can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to the abishai's Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is [[charmed]] by the abishai for 1 hour. While [[charmed]] in this way, the target regards the abishai as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if the abishai or its companions deal damage to the target.
