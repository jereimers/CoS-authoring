# War Caster

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Concentration

You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain [[Concentration]].

## Reactive Spell

When a creature provokes an [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]] from you by leaving your reach, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]]. The spell must have a casting time of one action and must target only that creature.

## Somatic Components

You can perform the Somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a [[Shield|XPHB]] in one or both hands.
