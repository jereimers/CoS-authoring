## Traits

**Fire Aura.** At the end of each of the salamander's turns, each creature of the salamander's choice in a 10-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the salamander takes 10 (**3d6**) Fire damage.

**Magic Resistance.** The salamander has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Flame Trident.** m,r +12, reach 5 ft. or range 30/90 ft. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) Piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) Fire damage. @homThe trident magically returns to the salamander's hand immediately after a ranged attack.
