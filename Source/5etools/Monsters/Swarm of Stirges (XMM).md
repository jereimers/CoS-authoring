## Traits

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can't regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]] or gain [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]].


## Actions

**Swarm of Proboscises.** m +5, reach 5 ft. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) Piercing damage, or 8 (**1d10 + 3**) Piercing damage if the swarm is [[Bloodied]]. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature in the swarm's space, the target has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 13). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 7 (**2d6**) Necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns.
