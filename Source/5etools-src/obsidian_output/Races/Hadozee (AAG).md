# Hadozee

**Size:** Small, Medium  
**Speed:** walk 30 ft., climb (equal to walking)  

## Size

You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

## Dexterous Feet

As a bonus action, you can use your feet to manipulate an object, open or close a door or container, or pick up or set down a Tiny object.

## Glide

When you fall at least 10 feet above the ground, you can use your reaction to extend your skin membranes to glide horizontally a number of feet equal to your walking speed, and you take 0 damage from the fall. You determine the direction of the glide.

## Hadozee Dodge

The magic that runs in your veins heightens your natural defenses. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a `d6`. Add your proficiency bonus to the number rolled, and reduce the damage you take by an amount equal to that total (minimum of 0 damage).

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
