# Spellfire Flare

*1st-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You unleash a blast of brilliant fire. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range; a target gains no benefit from [[Cover|XPHB]] or [[Cover|XPHB]] for this attack roll. On a hit, the target takes **2d10** Radiant damage.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

You create an additional blast for each spell slot level above 1. You can direct the blasts at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each blast.
