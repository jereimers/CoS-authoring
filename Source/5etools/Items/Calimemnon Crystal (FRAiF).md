# Calimemnon Crystal

*Wondrous Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement)*

This immaculately cut sixty-sided diamond fits in one hand, yet it contains an entire genie empire. The Calimemnon Crystal was made by high elf magic to imprison the notorious genie lords Calim and Memnon, who once ruled and warred over what is now Calimshan.

When viewed by a creature with [[Truesight|XPHB]], the normally beautiful diamond is a grotesque sight: trapped within the gemstone are more than a hundred genies, including the physical forms of Calim and Memnon. The genies scream and strain in agonized fury, pressing their belligerent faces against the walls of their crystal line prison.

## Properties of the Crystal

While attuned to the crystal, you gain the following benefits:

- **Arcane Focus:** You can use the Calimemnon Crystal as an Arcane Focus.
- **Flight:** You have a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] of 30 feet and can hover.
- **Spells:** You can cast these spells with the crystal (spell save DC 18): [[Create or Destroy Water|XPHB]], [[Enlarge/Reduce|XPHB]], [[Invisibility|XPHB]] (targeting yourself only), and [[Major Image|XPHB]].

## Aura of Cold

The temperature drops precipitously in a 20-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the crystal. Whenever the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there, the creature takes (`2d6`) Cold damage. A creature takes this damage only once per turn. While attuned to the crystal, you are unaffected by the aura, and you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to disable or enable the aura.

## Healing/Damage Rays

While holding the crystal, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to fire six rays of volatile energy from the crystal at one or more creatures within 60 feet. You can aim the rays at one target or at several. For each ray, choose one of the following effects:

- **Damage Ray:** The target makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking (`6d6 + 6`) Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Healing Ray:** The target regains `2d6 + 2` [[Hit Points|XPHB]].

This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Random Properties

The Artifact has the following random properties (see chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide):

- 1 [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|XDMG]] property
- 1 [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|XDMG]] property
- 1 [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|XDMG]] property
- 1 [[Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|XDMG]] property

## Destroying the Crystal

The Calimemnon Crystal is destroyed if the creature attuned to it casts the [[Wish|XPHB]] spell and wishes the crystal destroyed. Nothing else can harm it. When the crystal is destroyed, all the genies in the crystal are released.
