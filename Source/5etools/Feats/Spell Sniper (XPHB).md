# Spell Sniper

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Bypass Cover

Your attack rolls for spells ignore [[Cover|XPHB]] and [[Cover|XPHB]].

## Casting in Melee

Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on your attack rolls with spells.

## Increased Range

When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 10 feet and requires you to make an attack roll, you can increase the spell's range by 60 feet.
