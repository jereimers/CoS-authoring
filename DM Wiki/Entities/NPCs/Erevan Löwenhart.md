# Who They Were

Erevan Löwenhart was a legendary [[Dusk Elves|dusk elf]] prince and master bladesinger who led his people during the reign of [[King Barov von Zarovich II]]. He was [[Kasimir Velikov]]'s uncle and the last of the dusk elf royal line.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Kasimir's Tale]], the party learned:

- Erevan was a member of the Council of Princes that ruled the dusk elves in [[Othrondil]], the Forest of Twilight
- He was a master of bladesong and practiced "the style of the lion," bearing the lion's sigil as his personal symbol
- When [[King Barov von Zarovich II|King Barov]] demanded the dusk elves' fealty and tribute, Erevan refused to bow, igniting the war that would destroy his people
- [[Rahadin]], Kasimir's cousin and a traitor to the dusk elves, fought for King Barov during the conquest
- Rahadin shattered Erevan's blade and executed him along with the rest of the royal family, marking the end of the dusk elf royal line
- Erevan's broken blade survived and mysteriously appeared among [[Arden Nalero|Arden]]'s possessions as the [[Broken Blade]]
- [[Arden Nalero|Arden]] and Kasimir swore an oath over the blade to bring vengeance to Rahadin and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]

# The Lion's Sigil

Erevan's personal sigil was a lion, representing his bladesinging style and royal authority. This same sigil is etched into the [[Broken Blade]], confirming its identity as Erevan's shattered weapon.

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Tea with Kasimir|Session 13]] — [[Kasimir Velikov]] told the party about Erevan Löwenhart during [[Kasimir's Tale]]; [[Arden Nalero|Arden]] revealed the [[Broken Blade]] bearing Erevan's lion sigil
