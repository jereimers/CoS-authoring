# Winter's Dark Bite

*Item, Uncommon*

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This greatsword is made of an unknown black metal. In most cases, it works as a [[+1 greatsword]]. But when used against a [[thessalhydra|HftT]], it works as a [[+3 greatsword]]. While in the Upside Down, it works as a +4 greatsword.
