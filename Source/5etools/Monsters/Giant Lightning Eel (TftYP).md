## Traits

**Water Breathing.** The eel can breathe only underwater.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The eel makes two bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) lightning damage.

**Lightning Jolt {@recharge 5}.** One creature the eel touches within 5 feet of it outside water, or each creature within 15 feet of it in a body of water, must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On failed save, a target takes 13 (**3d8**) lightning damage. If the target takes any of this damage, the target is [[stunned]] until the end of the eel's next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't [[stunned]].
