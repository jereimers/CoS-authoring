## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the statue is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the statue move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the statue isn't an object.

**Ghostly Inhabitant.** The [[eidolon|MPMM]] that enters the statue remains inside it until the statue drops to 0 hit points, the eidolon uses a bonus action to move out of the statue, or the eidolon is turned or forced out by an effect such as the [[dispel evil and good]] spell. When the eidolon leaves the statue, it appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the statue.

**Inert.** Without an [[eidolon|MPMM]] inside, the statue is an object.

**Unusual Nature.** The statue doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The statue makes two Slam or Rock attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h43 (**6d12 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, range 60 ft./240 ft., one target. @h37 (**6d10 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.
