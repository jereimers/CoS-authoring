## Traits

**Heat Aura.** At the end of each of the remorhaz's turns, each creature in a 5-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the remorhaz takes 16 (**3d10**) Fire damage.


## Actions

**Bite.** m +11, reach 10 ft. @h18 (**2d10 + 7**) Piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) Fire damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 17), and it has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the grapple ends.


## Bonus Actions

**Swallow.** str DC 19, one Large or smaller creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by the remorhaz (it can have up to two creatures swallowed at a time). @actSaveFail The target is swallowed by the remorhaz, and the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition ends. A swallowed creature has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions, it has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 10 (**3d6**) Acid damage plus 10 (**3d6**) Fire damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns.

If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 5 feet of the remorhaz and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. If the remorhaz dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [[Prone|XPHB]].
