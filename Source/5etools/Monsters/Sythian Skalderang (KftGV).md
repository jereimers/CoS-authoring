## Traits

**Fear of Frogs and Toads.** Sythian is [[frightened]] while he is within 20 feet of a frog or a toad (of any size) that he can see.

**Graz'zt's Gift.** Sythian's AC includes his Charisma modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Sythian makes two Poisoned Shortsword or Poisoned Dart attacks and uses Whispers of Azzagrat.

**Poisoned Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) poison damage.

**Poisoned Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) poison damage.

**Whispers of Azzagrat.** Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from Sythian must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (**4d8**) psychic damage and is [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[incapacitated]].



## Reactions

**Fiendish Rebuke (3/Day).** Immediately after a creature within 5 feet of Sythian hits him with an attack roll, Sythian forces that creature to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 14 (**4d6**) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
