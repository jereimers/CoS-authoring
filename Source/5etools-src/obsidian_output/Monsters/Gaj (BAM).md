## Actions

**Multiattack.** The gaj makes one Mandibles attack and uses Mind-Probing Antennae or Paralyze (if available).

**Mandibles.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 11). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage at the start of each of the gaj's turns. While it is grappling a creature, the gaj can't use its mandibles to attack other creatures.

**Mind-Probing Antennae.** The gaj targets one creature [[grappled]] by it. The target must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 16 (**3d10**) psychic damage, and the gaj magically pulls one piece of information from the target's mind that the gaj wants to know. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the gaj learns nothing.

**Paralyze {@recharge}.** The gaj magically targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
