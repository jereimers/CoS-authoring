%% an area is a location, place, region, etc. It can be as large as the Planes of Existence and as small as a room inside a building inside a town inside a region inside a domain inside a continent/plane. Areas have types, are encountered by the party at a particular time/place, and can be home to multiple NPCs, items, etc. %%
# Overview

Lake Zarovich is a glassy, uncanny body of water located along the road between the [[Old Bonegrinder]] and [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. Its still surface reflects the perpetually overcast Barovian sky like a dark mirror. The lake holds a strange power over [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], who dreamed of this place long before ever setting foot upon its shores.

# What the party knows

- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] recognized the lake from her dreams, though she swore she had never visited it in life
- Something in her soul seemed to resonate with this place
- The party was ambushed by werewolves near the lake's shore
- Two werewolves they named "Hairy Bill" and "Bairy Hill" attacked the party here
- When the werewolves died, their monstrous forms peeled away to reveal two young Barovian men—victims of the curse
- [[Parriwimple]] was wounded during the battle, bearing the same type of wound that marked the dead werewolves—raising concerns about lycanthropy

# Notable places

- The pebbled shore where [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] stood in recognition
- The treeline from which the werewolves emerged

# Notable figures

- None resident; the area is dangerous

# Visits

- [[Session 08 - Hairy Bill, Bairy Hill, and a Coin for the Ladies Three#Lake Zarovich and the Werewolf Attack|Session 08]] - Ireena recognized the lake; the party fought werewolves
