## Traits

**Roleplaying Information.** The daughter of a Waterdhavian trader and a tavern server, Duvessa has her mother's talent for negotiation and her father's charm. As the first woman to serve as Town Speaker of Bryn Shander, and a young one at that, she has much to prove.

Ideal: "The people of Icewind Dale are survivors. They can weather any storm."

Bond: "My mother taught me what it means to be a good leader. I won't disappoint her."

Flaw: "I don't give an inch in any argument of conflict."


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h2 (**1d4**) piercing damage. Duvessa carries only one dagger.



## Reactions

**Parry.** Duvessa adds 2 to her AC against one melee attack that would hit her. To do so, Duvessa must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
