# Tome of Understanding

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

This book contains intuition and insight exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book's contents and practicing its guidelines, your Wisdom increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
