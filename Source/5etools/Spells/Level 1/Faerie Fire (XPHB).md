Objects in a 20-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] within range are outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed [[Dim Light|XPHB]] in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition.

[[Attack|XPHB]] rolls against an affected creature or object have [[Advantage|XPHB]] if the attacker can see it.
