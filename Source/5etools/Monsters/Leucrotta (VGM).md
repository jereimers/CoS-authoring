## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The leucrotta has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Kicking Retreat.** If the leucrotta attacks with its hooves, it can take the Disengage action as a bonus action.

**Mimicry.** The leucrotta can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check.

**Rampage.** When the leucrotta reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, it can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make an attack with its hooves.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The leucrotta makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its hooves.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage. If the leucrotta scores a critical hit, it rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.

**Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.
