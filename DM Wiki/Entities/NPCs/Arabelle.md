# Who they are

# What the Party Knows

From [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

## The Abduction

- Arabelle was abducted while playing in the woods near the [[Vistani Camp]]
- Her cousin [[Alexei]] was supposed to be watching her but got drunk on wine
- [[Yan]], a Vistani man, apparently gave Alexei the wine, then vanished
- [[Savid]], a [[Dusk Elves|dusk elf]] scout, found Yan's decapitated body at the [[Luna River]]
- The crime scene showed signs of a violent struggle
- A platinum ring bearing [[Khazan]]'s sigil was found at the scene

## The Investigation

- Footprints showed the abductor carried something child-sized toward the riverbank
- The party suspects [[Escher]] may be involved based on the evidence
- Her father [[Luvash]] is grief-stricken and desperate to find her
- The party has promised to bring Arabelle home safely

## Personal Details

- Lives with her father [[Luvash]] in the [[Vistani Camp]] west of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]

- Her birthday is coming up
