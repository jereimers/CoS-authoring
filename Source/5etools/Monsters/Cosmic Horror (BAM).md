## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the horror fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Unusual Nature.** The horror doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The horror makes one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h22 (**4d6 + 8**) piercing damage.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d6 + 8**) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the horror can't use this tentacle against other targets. The horror has `1d8 + 1` tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Psychic Whispers {@recharge 5}.** The horror emits dreadful whispers in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in the sphere that isn't an Aberration must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, taking 33 (**6d10**) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Crushing Tentacle.** The horror crushes one creature it is grappling. The [[grappled]] creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (**3d6 + 8**) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Poison Jet (Costs 2 Actions).** Foul gas squirts from the horror in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) poison damage.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** The horror teleports, along with any creatures it is grappling, to an unoccupied space it can see within 120 feet of itself.
