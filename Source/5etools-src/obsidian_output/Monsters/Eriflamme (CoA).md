## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the Eriflamme fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The Eriflamme has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Eriflamme makes four Claw attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with a Bite attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d6 + 10**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) fire damage.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h24 (**4d6 + 10**) piercing damage plus 33 (**6d10**) fire damage.

**Reform.** All the Eriflamme's fire elementals vanish and the Eriflamme reappears in one of their spaces. The Eriflamme's hit points are equivalent to the combined hit points of the fire elementals.



## Reactions

**Split (2/Day).** As a reaction to taking damage, the Eriflamme can split into fire elementals and reduce the damage to 0. The Eriflamme can form up to 10 [[fire elemental|]], splitting its remaining hit points between them. The fire elementals appear in spaces adjacent to or within the Eriflamme's old location, and all act on the Eriflamme's initiative. They gain a +5 bonus to attack rolls and have the Eriflamme's Reform action.


## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Slam.** The Eriflamme makes a Claw attack, which deals force damage instead of slashing damage if it hits.

**Fireglide.** The Eriflamme moves up to half its speed. It can fly during this movement.

**Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).** The Eriflamme makes a Bite attack with advantage.
