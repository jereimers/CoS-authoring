## Traits

**Keen Sight.** The nothic has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nothic makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Rotting Gaze.** The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against this magic or take 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage.

**Weird Insight.** The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must contest its Charisma ([[Deception]]) check against the nothic's Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check. If the nothic wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being [[charmed]].
