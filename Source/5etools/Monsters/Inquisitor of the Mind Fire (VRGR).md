**Mind Fire.** The inquisitor targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 17 (**3d8 + 4**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] until the start of the inquisitor's next turn.

**Inquisitor's Command {@recharge 5}.** Each creature of the inquisitor's choice that it can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [[charmed]] until the start of the inquisitor's next turn. On the [[charmed]] target's turn, the inquisitor can telepathically control the target's move, action, or both. When controlled in this way, the target can take only the Attack (inquisitor chooses the target) or Dash action.
