## Traits

**Pack Leader.** The aurumvorax's allies have advantage on attack rolls while within 10 feet of the aurumvorax, provided it isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Tunneler.** The aurumvorax can burrow through solid rock and metal at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The aurumvorax makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature wearing armor of any type, the aurumvorax gains one of the following benefits of its choice:

**Frenzy.** The aurumvorax has advantage on attack rolls until start of its next turn.

**Invigorate.** The aurumvorax regains 6 (`1d8 + 2`) hit points.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the aurumvorax can't use its Claw attack on another target, and when it moves, it can drag the [[grappled]] creature with it, without the aurumvorax's speed being halved.
