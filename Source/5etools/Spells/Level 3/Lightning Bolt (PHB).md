A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes **8d6** lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `8d6` for each slot level above 3rd.
