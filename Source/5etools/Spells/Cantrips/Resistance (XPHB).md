You touch a willing creature and choose a damage type: Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Piercing, Poison, Radiant, Slashing, or Thunder. When the creature takes damage of the chosen type before the spell ends, the creature reduces the total damage taken by `1d4`. A creature can benefit from this spell only once per turn.
