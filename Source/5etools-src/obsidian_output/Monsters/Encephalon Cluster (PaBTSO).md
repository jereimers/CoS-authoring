## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the cluster fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The cluster has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cluster makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Spawn Progeny if available.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage, and if the target is a creature, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition. If this attack reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target immediately dies and is consumed by the cluster.

**Spawn Progeny (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The cluster bulges and spews `1d4` mature eggs. Each egg lands in an unoccupied space of the cluster's choice within 30 feet of itself and immediately transforms into an [[encephalon gemmule|PaBTSO]]. The gemmules obey the cluster's commands and take their turns immediately after it.



## Reactions

**Aggressive Hunger.** Immediately after being hit by an attack, the cluster moves up to its speed toward the attacker. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. If the cluster ends this movement within 5 feet of the attacker, it then makes one Slam attack against that attacker.
