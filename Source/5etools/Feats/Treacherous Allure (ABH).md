# Treacherous Allure

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Enchanting Presence

You always have the [[Charm Person|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot, and you must finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]] before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast it using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability increased by this feat.

## Inevitable Betrayal

You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against creatures with the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition.
