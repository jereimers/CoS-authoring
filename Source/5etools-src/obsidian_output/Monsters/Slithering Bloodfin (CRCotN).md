## Traits

**Death Burst.** When the bloodfin dies, it explodes in a cloud of toxic blood. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the exploding bloodfin, including any creature swallowed by the bloodfin, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) poison damage. A creature inside the bloodfin when it explodes falls [[prone]] in the space formerly occupied by the bloodfin and is no longer [[blinded]] or [[restrained]] by it.

**Water Breathing.** The bloodfin can breathe only underwater.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The bloodfin makes one Bite attack and one Tail attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit (with advantage if the target is a creature missing any hit points), reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the bloodfin can't bite another target.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit (with advantage if the target is a creature missing any hit points), reach 10 ft., one target. @h19 (**4d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Swallow.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature the bloodfin is grappling. @hThe bloodfin swallows the target. The swallowed creature is no longer [[grappled]] but is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]]. It has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the bloodfin, it takes 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns, and the bloodfin regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. A bloodfin can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

If the bloodfin takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the bloodfin must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls [[prone]] in a space within 5 feet of the bloodfin and is no longer [[blinded]] or [[restrained]] by it.
