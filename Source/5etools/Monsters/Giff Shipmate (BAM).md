## Traits

**Firearms Knowledge.** The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of any firearm.

**Steady as She Goes.** On the deck of a ship, the giff has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made against effects that would knock it [[prone]] or shove it overboard.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giff makes two Longsword or Musket attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Musket.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d12 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Force Grenade.** The giff throws a grenade up to 60 feet, and the grenade explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (**5d6**) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the grenade, roll a `d6`; on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more grenades to throw.
