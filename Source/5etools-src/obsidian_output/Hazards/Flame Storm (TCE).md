# Flame Storm

Sooty thunderclouds shot through with red and orange lightning release a deluge of fiery droplets. Any creature caught in the burning rain takes **2d6** fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The droplets ignite any flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried; otherwise, the droplets burn out immediately. The smoke, soot, crackle, and low roar of the storm impose disadvantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks and ranged attack rolls.

A flame storm usually lasts `2d4` minutes, though the originating storm clouds can persist for days, creating multiple flame storms.
