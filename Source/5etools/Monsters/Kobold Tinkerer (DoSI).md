## Traits

**Inquiring Mind (1/Day).** The kobold can cast [[detect magic]], requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability.

**Pack Tactics.** The kobold has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Alchemical Flame {@recharge}.** The kobold unleashes fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
