# Mark of Passage

You gain the following benefits.

## Courier's Speed

Your [[Speed|XPHB]] increases by 5 feet.

## Intuitive Motion

When you make a Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) check, you can roll `1d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

## Magical Passage

You always have the [[Misty Step|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat).

## Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Passage Spells table are added to that feature's spell list.
