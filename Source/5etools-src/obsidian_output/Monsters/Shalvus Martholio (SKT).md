## Traits

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** Shalvus deals an extra 7 (**2d6**) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Shalvus that isn't [[incapacitated]] and Shalvus doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Roleplaying Information.** Nalaskur Thaelond of Bargewright Inn has entrusted the shepherd Shalvus with an important assignment: to figure out the best way by which Goldenfields can be brought under the Black Network's control. Shalvus believes that success will ensure his swift rise through the Zhentarim ranks.

Ideal: "I'll do what it takes to prove myself to the Zhentarim."

Bond: "I love animals, and I'm very protective of them."

Flaw: "I can't resist taking risks to feed my ambitions."
