# Mark of Sentinel

You gain the following benefits.

## Sentinel's Intuition

When you make a Wisdom ([[Insight|XPHB]] or [[Perception|XPHB]]) check, you can roll `1d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

## Guardian's Shield

You always have the [[Shield|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat).

## Vigilant Guardian

When a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to swap places with that creature, and you are hit by the attack instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]] and regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Sentinel Spells table are added to that feature's spell list.
