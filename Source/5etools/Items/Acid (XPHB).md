# Acid

*Item, None*

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a vial of Acid. Target one creature or object you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or take **2d6** Acid damage.
