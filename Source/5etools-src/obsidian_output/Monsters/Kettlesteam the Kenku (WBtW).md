## Traits

**Mimicry.** Kettlesteam can mimic any sounds she has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations only with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Kettlesteam makes two Dagger attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Twilight Sleep (2/Day).** Kettlesteam targets one creature she can see within 10 feet of her. The target is engulfed in a cloud of magical, sleep-inducing gas and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 minute. A creature put to sleep by this gas awakens instantly if it takes damage, or if someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.
