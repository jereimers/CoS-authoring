# Mounted Combatant

You are a dangerous foe to face while [[mounted|PHB]]. While you are mounted and aren't [[incapacitated]], you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller than your mount.
- You can force an attack targeted at your mount to target you instead.
- If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
