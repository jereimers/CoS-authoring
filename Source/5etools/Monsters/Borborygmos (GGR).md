## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Borborygmos fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Poor Depth Perception.** Borborygmos has disadvantage on any attack roll against a target more than 30 feet away.

**Siege Monster.** Borborygmos deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Borborygmos can use his Frightful Presence. He also makes two attacks: one with his maul and one with his stomp.

**Maul.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h28 (**6d6 + 7**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Stomp.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h18 (**2d10 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +13 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h29 (**4d10 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Borborygmos's choice that is within 60 feet of him and can see or hear him must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of him for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Borborygmos's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** Borborygmos makes a weapon attack.

**Bellow (Costs 2 Actions).** Borborygmos yells menacingly at one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. That creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of him for 1 minute. If the creature is already [[frightened]], it becomes [[stunned]] instead. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Borborygmos's Bellow for the next 24 hours.

**Wide Berth (Costs 3 Actions).** Borborygmos moves up to half his speed and can move through the space of any creature smaller than Huge. The first time Borborygmos enters a creature's space during this move, the creature must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is pushed 5 feet away from Borborygmos. If the saving throw fails, that creature is knocked [[prone]], and Borborygmos can make a stomp attack against it.
