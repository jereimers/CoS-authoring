## Traits

**Devastating Roll.** The juggernaut can move through the space of a [[prone]] creature. A creature whose space the juggernaut enters for the first time on a turn must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (**10d10**) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Immutable Form.** The juggernaut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Regeneration.** As long as it has 1 hit point left, the juggernaut magically regains all its hit points daily at dawn. The juggernaut is destroyed and doesn't regenerate if it drops to 0 hit points.

**Siege Monster.** The juggernaut deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h25 (**3d12 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
