## Traits

**Aura of Blood Thirst.** If the flind isn't [[incapacitated]], any creature with the Rampage trait can make a Bite attack as a bonus action while within 10 feet of the flind.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The flind makes one Flail of Chaos attack, one Flail of Pain attack, and one Flail of Paralysis attack, or it makes three Longbow attacks.

**Flail of Chaos.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must use its reaction, if available, to make one melee attack against a random creature, other than the flind, within its reach. If there's no creature within reach, the target instead moves half its speed in a random direction.

**Flail of Pain.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 16 (**3d10**) psychic damage.

**Flail of Paralysis.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage.
