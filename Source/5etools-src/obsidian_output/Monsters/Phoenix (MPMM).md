## Traits

**Fiery Death and Rebirth.** If the phoenix dies, it explodes. Each creature in 60-foot-radius sphere centered on the phoenix must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

The explosion destroys the phoenix's body and leaves behind an egg-shaped cinder, which weighs 5 pounds. The cinder deals 21 (**6d6**) fire damage to any creature that touches it, though no more than once per round. The cinder is immune to all damage, and after `1d6` days, it hatches a new phoenix.

**Fire Form.** The phoenix can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

Any creature that touches the phoenix or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (**1d10**) fire damage. In addition, the phoenix can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes 5 (**1d10**) fire damage.

With a touch, the phoenix can also ignite flammable objects that aren't worn or carried (no action required).

**Flyby.** The phoenix doesn't provoke [[opportunity attack|]] when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Illumination.** The phoenix sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the phoenix fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Siege Monster.** The phoenix deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The phoenix makes two attacks: one Beak attack and one Fiery Talons attack.

**Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d6 + 8**) fire damage.

**Fiery Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d8 + 8**) fire damage.

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Move.** The phoenix moves up to its speed.

**Peck.** The phoenix makes one beak attack.

**Swoop (Costs 2 Actions).** The phoenix moves up to its speed and makes one Fiery Talons attack.
