## Traits

**Tunneler.** The worm can burrow through solid rock at half its [[Burrow Speed|XPHB]] and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The worm makes one Bite attack and one Tail Stinger attack.

**Bite.** m +14, reach 10 ft. @h22 (**3d8 + 9**) Piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 19), and it has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the grapple ends.

**Tail Stinger.** m +14, reach 10 ft. @h16 (**2d6 + 9**) Piercing damage plus 35 (**10d6**) Poison damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Swallow.** str DC 19, one Large or smaller creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by the worm (it can have up to three creatures swallowed at a time). @actSaveFail The target is swallowed by the worm, and the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition ends. A swallowed creature has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions, has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and takes 17 (**5d6**) Acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 5 feet of the worm and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. If the worm dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and can escape from the corpse using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[Prone|XPHB]].
