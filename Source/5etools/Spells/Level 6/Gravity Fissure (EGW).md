You manifest a ravine of gravitational energy in a line originating from you that is 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Constitution saving throw, taking **8d8** force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each creature within 10 feet of the line but not in it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take **8d8** force damage and be pulled toward the line until the creature is in its area.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by `8d8` for each slot level above 6th.
