# Crossbow Expert

Thanks to extensive practice with the crossbow, you gain the following benefits:

- You ignore the loading quality of crossbows with which you are proficient.
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
- When you use the [[Attack]] action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a [[hand crossbow|phb]] you are holding.
