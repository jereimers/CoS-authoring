# Crossbow Expert

**Prerequisites:** Level 4, DEX 13+

You gain the following benefits.

## Ignore Loading

You ignore the LD property of the [[Hand Crossbow|XPHB]], [[Heavy Crossbow|XPHB]], and [[Light Crossbow|XPHB]] (all called crossbows elsewhere in this feat). If you're holding one of them, you can load a piece of ammunition into it even if you lack a free hand.

## Firing in Melee

Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on your attack rolls with crossbows.

## Dual Wielding

When you make the extra attack of the L property, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the extra attack if that attack is with a crossbow that has the L property and you aren't already adding that modifier to the damage.
