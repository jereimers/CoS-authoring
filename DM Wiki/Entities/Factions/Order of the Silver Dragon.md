%% A faction is a group of people connected by common ethnicity, political cause, or other mission/identity/goal. They can be organized to varying degrees. %%
# Who they are

According to scraps of legend and what little could be shared by [[Standimir]], the Order of the Silver Dragon was a group of knights who opposed [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], but were defeated and utterly destroyed centuries ago.
# What the party knows

- The Order was headquartered at a mansion west of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] called [[Argynvostholt]]
- The former knights of the order persist as revenants, vengeful undead warriors with a single mission. They are under the command of [[Commander Vladimir Horngaard]].
- Standimir urged the party to seek out [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]] at Argynvostholt for more information.
# Where we've seen them

- [[Session 07 - The Tarokka Reading#The Watchtower|Session 7]] - [[Fig Fleetfoot|Fig]] found a cool silver pendant necklace shaped like a dragon. It's always cold to the touch.
- [[Session 08 - Hairy Bill, Bairy Hill, and a Coin for the Ladies Three#Tser Falls and the Standimir Revenant 's Counsel|Session 8]] - convo with Standimir.
