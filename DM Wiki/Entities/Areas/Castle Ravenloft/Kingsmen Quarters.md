%% --- Page 107 --- %%
This dark passage runs for twenty feet, connecting an archway to the west with an ascending stone staircase to the east. To the north and south are four ten-footsquare alcoves cluttered with rotting cots and dirty rags. The ceilings here are covered with yellow lichen.

The yellow lichen is harmless. Beyond the archway to the west is area K70. The staircase (area K20a) that goes up along the east wall leads to area K20.

## Treasure 

Three of the alcoves contain nothing of value. A loose flagstone in the southeast alcove covers a hidden cubbyhole in the floor, in which is hidden a moldy sack containing 150 ep. The coins have the profiled visage of Strahd von Zarovich stamped on them. A character who searches the alcove can find the loose flagstone with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.
