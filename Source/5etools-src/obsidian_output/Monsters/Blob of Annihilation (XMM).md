## Traits

**Astral Implosion.** If the blob is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it implodes and ejects any creatures and objects engulfed by it into the Astral Sea. The blob itself vanishes, leaving behind a layer of slime on everything that was within 600 feet of it. In `1d20` years, the blob reconstitutes on a random world in the Material Plane.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If the blob fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The blob has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The blob makes two Pseudopod attacks and uses Engulf. It can replace one attack with a use of Restraining Glob.

**Pseudopod.** m +15, reach 30 ft. @h24 (**3d10 + 8**) Force damage.

**Engulf.** The blob moves up to its [[Speed|XPHB]] and can move through the spaces of Huge or smaller creatures and objects. str DC 23, each creature or object whose space the blob enters for the first time during this move. @actSaveFail The target is engulfed. While engulfed, a target has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the blob, and when the blob moves, the engulfed target moves with it. A nonmagical object is destroyed after spending 1 minute engulfed.

While engulfed, a creature takes 21 (**6d6**) Force damage at the start of each of its turns, is suffocating, has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition, and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns. An engulfed creature that is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] dissolves into ash, which is ejected into the Astral Sea. @actSaveSuccess The target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.

**Restraining Glob.** The blob lobs a slimy glob at one Large or smaller creature it can see within 600 feet of itself. dex DC 23, the targeted creature. @actSaveFail 18 (**3d6 + 8**) Acid damage. The glob rolls the target 60 feet straight toward the blob, and the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the end of its next turn, when the glob harmlessly dissolves. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.




## Legendary Actions
