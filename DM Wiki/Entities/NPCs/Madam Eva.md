## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Madam Eva appears as a wise, yet maddened crone who speaks in prophecies and riddles. To those she trusts, she appears as a kind, yet frustratingly opaque and stubborn old woman.

### Morale
In a fight, Madam Eva would calmly insist that her opponent cease their attacks, then—if her Vistani aides prove unable to stop her assailant—weaken them with the harm spell before demanding their surrender.

### Relationships
Madam Eva alone knows that she is an avatar of the Seeker.
