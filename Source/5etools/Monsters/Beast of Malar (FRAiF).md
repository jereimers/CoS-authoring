## Traits

**Amphibious (Sea Form Only).** The beast breathes air and water.

**Divine Immortality.** If the beast dies, its body dissolves into black goo, and it gains a new body after `1d10` days, reviving with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] in a place of Malar's choosing.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the beast fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The beast has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** The beast regains 20 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] at the start of its turn. If the beast takes Radiant damage or damage from a [[Critical Hit|XPHB]], this trait doesn't function at the start of the beast's next turn. The beast dies only if it starts its turn with 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] and doesn't regenerate.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The beast makes three attacks, using Bite or Claws in any combination.

**Bite.** m +9, reach 5 ft. @h23 (**4d8 + 5**) Piercing damage.

**Claws (Land or Sky Form Only).** m +9, reach 5 ft. @h18 (**3d8 + 5**) Slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.


## Bonus Actions

**Recuperative Shape-Shift.** The beast shape-shifts into its land form, sea form, or sky form and regains 9 (`2d8`) [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. Its game statistics are the same in each form, except where noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
