# Baba Yaga's Dancing Broom

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

The archfey [[Baba Yaga|XDMG]] crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to transform it into an [[Animated Broom|XMM]] under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count and remains animate until you take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] and use a command word to render it inanimate.

On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the broom is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its inanimate form before losing all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] it regains all of them.
