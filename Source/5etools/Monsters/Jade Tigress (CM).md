## Traits

**Unarmored Defense.** While Jade Tigress is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, her AC includes her Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Jade Tigress makes three attacks.

**Force Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of Jade Tigress's next turn.

**Poisoned Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage plus 7 (**3d4**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]].

**Heal Self (Recharges after a Long Rest).** Jade Tigress regains `2d8 + 2` hit points, and all levels of [[exhaustion]] end on her.


## Bonus Actions

**Nimble Escape.** Jade Tigress takes the Disengage or Hide action.


## Reactions

**Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, Jade Tigress deflects the missile. The damage she takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 9`. If the damage is reduced to 0, Jade Tigress catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and Jade Tigress has a hand free.
