## Traits

**Evasion.** If Imoen is subjected to an effect that allows her to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Imoen instead takes no damage if she succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if she fails.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** Imoen deals an extra 14 (**4d6**) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Imoen that isn't incapacitated and Imoen doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Spider Climb.** Imoen can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Imoen has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Imoen makes two Shortsword attacks and one Hand Crossbow attack.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) poison damage.
