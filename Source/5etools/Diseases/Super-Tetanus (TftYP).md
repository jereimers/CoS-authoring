# Super-Tetanus

A creature that contracts the disease of super-tetanus is wracked with pain as its heart races and its muscles spasm hard enough to break its bones. The creature takes 11 (**2d10**) damage at the start of each of its turns. If a victim is not cured by other means, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every minute after becoming exposed, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.
