**Roleplaying Information**

***Motivations.*** Doru wants to reconcile with his father and ensure Gertruda's safety.

***Inspirations.*** When playing Doru, channel Theon Grejoy (Game of Thrones), Zuko (Avatar: The Last Airbender), Jesse Pinkman (Breaking Bad), and Steve Harrington (Stranger Things).

**Character Information**
