# Satyr

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 35  

## Creature Type

You are a Fey.

## Ram

You can use your head and horns to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals **1d6** + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

## Magic Resistance

You have advantage on saving throws against spells.

## Mirthful Leaps

Whenever you make a long jump or a high jump, you can roll a `d8` and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as usual.

## Reveler

As an embodiment of revelry, you have proficiency in the [[Performance]] and [[Persuasion]] skills, and you have proficiency with one [[musical instrument|PHB]] of your choice.
