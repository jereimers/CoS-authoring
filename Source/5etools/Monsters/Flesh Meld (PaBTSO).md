## Traits

**Amorphous.** The flesh meld can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.

**Aura of Death.** At the start of each of the flesh meld's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (**1d6**) necrotic damage and have the [[poisoned]] condition until the start of the flesh meld's next turn.

**Magic Resistance.** The flesh meld has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The flesh meld can climb difficult surfaces, including ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The flesh meld makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 15) and is pulled up to 15 feet toward the flesh meld.


## Bonus Actions

**Consume Creature.** The flesh meld targets one Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of itself that it's grappling. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the flesh meld. The flesh meld can have one creature swallowed at a time.

A swallowed creature no longer has the [[grappled]] condition. While swallowed, it has the [[blinded]] and [[restrained]] conditions, has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the flesh meld, and takes 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage at the start of each of the flesh meld's turns. If this damage reduces a swallowed creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies, and the flesh meld consumes its body.

If the flesh meld takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the flesh meld must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls with the [[prone]] condition in a space within 5 feet of the flesh meld. If the flesh meld dies, the swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting with the [[prone]] condition.
