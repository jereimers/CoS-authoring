## Traits

**Amphibious.** The skyswimmer can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The skyswimmer makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its slam.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the skyswimmer. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the skyswimmer, and it takes 21 (**6d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the skyswimmer's turns. If the skyswimmer takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the skyswimmer must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the skyswimmer. If the skyswimmer dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d12 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.
