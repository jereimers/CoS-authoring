# Multiattack: Volley

**Class:** [[Ranger]]  
**Level:** 11

You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.
