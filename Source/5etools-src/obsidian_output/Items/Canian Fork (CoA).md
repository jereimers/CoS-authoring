# Canian Fork

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one additional attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.

## Curse

You're unwilling to part with this weapon while attuned to it. You're also vulnerable to radiant damage and each time you receive magical healing, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the healing has no effect. Only the [[Remove Curse]] spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

## Corrupting

This item corrupts. See the "[[Infernal Item Corruption|CoA]]" section.
