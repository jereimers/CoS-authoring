# Ring of X-ray Vision

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead block the vision.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level.
