## Traits

**Dark One's Blessing.** When Bol'bara reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, she gains 6 temporary hit points.

**Nimble Escape.** Bol'bara can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of her turns.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Bol'bara makes two melee attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Eldritch Blast (Cantrip).** Ranged Spell Attack +4 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) force damage.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Incorporeal Dash.** Bol'bara moves up to her speed. She can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.

**Zone of Calamity (Costs 2 Actions).** A 15-foot-radius sphere of magical confusion extends from a point Bol'bara can see within 60 feet of her and spreads around corners. Each creature that starts its turn in that area is treated as if targeted by the [[confusion]] spell (save DC 12). The sphere lasts as long as Bol'bara maintains [[concentration]], up to 1 minute (as if [[concentration]] on a spell).
