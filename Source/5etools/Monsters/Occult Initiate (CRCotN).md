## Actions

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) psychic damage.

**Arcane Blast {@recharge 5}.** The initiate creates an explosion of magical force in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 10 (**3d6**) force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the center of the area. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
