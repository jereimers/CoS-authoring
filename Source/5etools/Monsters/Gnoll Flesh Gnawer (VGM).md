## Traits

**Rampage.** When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The gnoll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its shortsword.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Sudden Rush.** Until the end of the turn, the gnoll's speed increases by 60 feet and it doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
