## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The duergar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Psychic Engine.** When the duergar suffers a critical hit or is reduced to 0 hit points, psychic energy erupts from its frame to deal 14 (**4d6**) psychic damage to each creature within 5 feet of it.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The duergar makes two Iron Fist attacks and two Stomping Foot attacks. After one of the attacks, the duergar can move up to its speed without provoking [[opportunity attack|]]. It can replace one of the attacks with a use of Flame Jet.

**Iron Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h23 (**4d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 30 feet away in a straight line and be knocked [[prone]].

**Stomping Foot.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, or 21 (**3d10 + 5**) to a [[prone]] target.

**Flame Jet.** The duergar spews flames in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
