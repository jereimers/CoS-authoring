# Staff of Swarming Insects

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This staff has 10 charges.

## Insect Cloud

While holding the staff , you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to fill a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes, making the area [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]] for creatures other than you. A strong wind (like that created by [[Gust of Wind|XPHB]]) disperses the swarm and ends the effect.

## Spells

While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack modifier. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell.

| Spell | Charge Cost |
|---|---|
| [[Giant Insect|XPHB]] | 4 |
| [[Insect Plague|XPHB]] | 5 |

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, a swarm of insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.
