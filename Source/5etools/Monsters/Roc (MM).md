## Traits

**Keen Sight.** The roc has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The roc makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

**Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h27 (**4d8 + 9**) piercing damage.

**Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h23 (**4d6 + 9**) slashing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the roc can't use its talons on another target.
