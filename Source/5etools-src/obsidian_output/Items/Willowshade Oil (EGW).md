# Willowshade Oil

*Item, None*

A dark blue oil can be extracted from the rare fruit of the willowshade plant. A creature can use its action to apply the oil to another creature that has been [[petrified]] for less than 1 minute, causing the [[petrified]] condition on that creature to end at the start of what would be that creature's next turn.
