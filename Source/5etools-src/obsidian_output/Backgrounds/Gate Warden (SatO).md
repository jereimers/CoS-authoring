# Gate Warden

- **Skill Proficiencies::** [[Persuasion]], [[Survival]]
- **Languages::** Two of your choice (Abyssal, Celestial, or Infernal recommended)
- **Equipment::** A ring of keys to unknown locks, a blank [[book|PHB]], an [[ink pen|PHB]] or quill, a bottle of black ink, a set of [[traveler's clothes|PHB]], and a [[pouch|PHB]] containing 10 gp

## Feature: Planar Infusion

Living in a gate-town or a similar location steeped you in planar energy. You gain the [[Scion of the Outer Planes|SatO]] feat. In addition, you know where to find free, modest lodging and food in the community you grew up in.

## Suggested Characteristics

The influence of an Outer Plane shapes your perspective. The Gate Warden Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character.

| d6 | Personality Trait |
|---|---|
| 1 | Strange events and otherworldly creatures don't faze me. |
| 2 | I think in terms of exchange: something for something, nothing for nothing. |
| 3 | I speak with an unusual cadence. |
| 4 | I pepper my speech with words or curses borrowed from planar languages. |
| 5 | I've seen enough to know that you can't take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone. |
| 6 | I have a superstitious habit I picked up from my gate-town, such as touching iron when I'm nervous or arranging objects in a specific order. |

## Building a Gate Warden Character

Those who dwell for an extended time near a permanent portal to another plane absorb the essence radiating from the realm beyond. Those influenced by the same plane share similarities in behavior and even physical appearance.

### Gate Warden Trinkets

When you make your character, you can roll once on the [[Gate Warden Trinket|SatO]] table, instead of on the [[Trinket|PHB]] table in the Player's Handbook, for your starting trinket.
