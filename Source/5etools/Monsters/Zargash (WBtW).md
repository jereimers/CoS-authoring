## Traits

**Cling to Life (Recharges after a Long Rest).** The first time Zargash would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, he instead drops to 1 hit point.

**Special Equipment.** Zargash wears a bat-shaped amulet that has the properties of a [[ring of feather falling]].


## Actions

**Warhammer.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, or 7 (**1d10 + 2**) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands.

**Deathly Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. @h25 (**4d10 + 3**) necrotic damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Animate Corpse (1/Day).** Zargash targets the lifeless corpse of one Humanoid he can see within 30 feet of him and commands it to rise, transforming it into a zombie under his control. The zombie takes its turn immediately after Zargash. Animating the zombie requires Zargash's [[concentration]] (as if [[concentration]] on a spell). The zombie reverts to an inanimate corpse after 10 minutes, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when Zargash's [[concentration]] ends.
