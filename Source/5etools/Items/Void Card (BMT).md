# Void Card

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

As an action, you can brandish this card and attempt to banish up to three creatures you can see within 120 feet of yourself. If the target is from a different plane of existence than the plane you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be banished, returning to that other plane. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
