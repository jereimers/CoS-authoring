## Traits

**Fear Frenzy.** The horror has advantage on attack rolls against [[frightened]] creatures.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the horror has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) psychic damage.

**Frightening Screech {@recharge 5}.** The horror screeches. Each creature within 30 feet of it that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of it for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the horror's Frightening Screech for the next 24 hours.
