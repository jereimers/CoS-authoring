## Traits

**Hustle.** The underboss can move through the space of any creature that is of a larger size, but it can't stop there.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The underboss makes three attacks, using [[Poisoned|XPHB]] Blade or Arcane Firearm in any combination.

**Poisoned Blade.** m +7, reach 5 ft. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) Slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) Poison damage, and the target has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition until the start of the underboss's next turn. If the target is already [[Poisoned|XPHB]], it instead takes an extra 7 (**2d6**) Poison damage.

**Arcane Firearm.** r +7, range 30/90 ft. @h26 (**4d10 + 4**) Force damage.



## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** @actTrigger The underboss is hit by an attack roll. @actResponse The underboss halves the damage (round down) it takes from that attack.
