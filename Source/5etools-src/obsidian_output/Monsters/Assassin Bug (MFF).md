## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The assassin bug has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The assassin bug makes two bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] this way, the target is [[paralyzed]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Ovipositor.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @hThe target is infested with `1d3` assassin bug eggs, which immediately hatch into assassin bug maggots. At the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes **1d6** piercing damage per maggot infesting it. Applying fire to the bite wound before the end of the target's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the target and kills these assassin bug maggots. After this time, the maggots are too far under the skin to be burned.

If a target infested by assassin bug maggots ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the maggots burrow into its heart and kill it. Any effect that cures disease kills all assassin bug maggots infesting the target.
