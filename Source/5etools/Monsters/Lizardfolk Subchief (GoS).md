## Traits

**Hold Breath.** The subchief can hold its breath for 15 minutes.


## Actions

**Tooth Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Jaws of Semuanya {@recharge 5}.** The subchief invokes the primal magic of Semuanya, summoning a spectral maw around a target it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**5d8**) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw is also [[frightened]] until the end of its next turn.
