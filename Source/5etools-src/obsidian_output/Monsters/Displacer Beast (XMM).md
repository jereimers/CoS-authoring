## Traits

**Avoidance.** If the displacer beast is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the save and half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.

**Displacement.** Attack rolls against the displacer beast have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]], since it projects an illusion that makes it appear to be near its actual location. This trait is suppressed while the displacer beast has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The displacer beast makes one Rend attack and one Tentacle attack.

**Rend.** m +6, reach 5 feet. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) Slashing damage. If target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.

**Tentacle.** m +6, reach 10 feet. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) Piercing damage.
