## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** Coral has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Coral makes two Hoof attacks and uses Tail Thump.

**Hoof.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Tail Thump.** Coral slams her tail down, unleashing a burst of magical force toward one creature she can see within 60 feet of her. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (**4d10**) force damage and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target dies, and its body is reduced to fine dust.


## Bonus Actions

**Bubbles of Whimsy (2/Day).** Coral produces a stream of magical bubbles from her horn. These bubbles float toward a creature Coral can see within 60 feet of herself. Roll a `d6` to determine the bubbles' effect:

- **1-2: Bolstering Treat:** The bubbles transform into `1d4` cookies that appear in the target's space. The target gains 11 (`2d8 + 2`) temporary hit points if it immediately uses its reaction to eat one of the cookies. Any leftover cookies are delicious but confer no benefits.
- **3-4: Sparkle Burst:** The bubbles transform into glitter that swirls around the target before bursting outward. Each creature within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or have the [[blinded]] condition until the start of Coral's next turn.
- **5-6: Stink Bomb Shield:** The bubbles transform into a foul-smelling cloud of gas that surrounds and shields the target. The target has Cover until the gas disappears at the start of Coral's next turn.

**Gift of Speech (1/Day).** Coral targets one Beast she can see within 10 feet of herself. The target gains the ability to understand and speak Common or Sylvan (Coral's choice) for 10 minutes.
