# Spray of Cards

*2nd-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (15-feet cone)  
**Components:** V, S, M (a deck of cards)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You spray a 15-foot cone of spectral cards. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **2d10** force damage and has the [[blinded]] condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `2d10` for each slot level above 2nd.
