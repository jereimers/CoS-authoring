## Traits

**Malfunction.** Whenever the autognome takes 15 damage or more from a single source and isn't reduced to 0 hit points by that damage, roll a `d20` to determine if it suffers a malfunction:

- **1-10: "All Fine Here!":** No malfunction occurs.
- **11-12: "My Mind Is Going. I Can Feel It.":** The autognome is [[incapacitated]] for 1 minute.
- **13-14: "You've Disarmed Me!":** One of the autognome's arms falls off, reducing the number of Shock attacks it can make by 1 until a creature uses an action to reattach the arm.
- **15-16: "Who Turned Out the Lights?":** The autognome's head falls off and deactivates, causing the autognome to be [[blinded]] and [[deafened]] until a creature uses an action to reattach the head, which reactivates it.
- **17-20: "Have a Magical Day!":** The autognome explodes and is destroyed. Each creature within 20 feet of the exploding autognome must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Unusual Nature:** The autognome doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The autognome makes two Shock attacks.

**Shock.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h7 (**2d6**) lightning damage.
