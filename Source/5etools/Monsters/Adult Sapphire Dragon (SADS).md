## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Spider Climb.** The dragon can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and can choose to leave a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two melee attacks, one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) thunder damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Debilitating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a pulse of high-pitched, nearly inaudible sound in a 60-foot-cone. Each creature in that cone must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 45 (**13d6**) thunder damage and is [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[incapacitated]].




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Telekinetic Fling.** The dragon chooses a Small or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried that it can see within 60 feet of it, and magically hurls the object at a creature it can see within 60 feet of the object. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (**4d6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it.
