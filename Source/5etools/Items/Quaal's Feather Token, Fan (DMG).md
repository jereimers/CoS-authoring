# Quaal's Feather Token, Fan

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect.

## Fan

If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.
