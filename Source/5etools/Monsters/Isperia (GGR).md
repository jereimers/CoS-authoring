## Traits

**Inscrutable.** Isperia is immune to any effect that would sense her emotions or read her thoughts, as well as any divination spell that she refuses. Wisdom ([[Insight]]) checks made to ascertain her intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Isperia fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Isperia has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Isperia makes two claw attacks. She can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action in place of one claw attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d10 + 5**) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) psychic damage after each attack it makes against Isperia before the start of her next turn.

**Supreme Legal Authority.** Isperia chooses up to three creatures she can see within 90 feet of her. Each target must succeed on a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw or Isperia chooses an action for that target: Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, or Use an Object. The affected target can't take that action for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can end the effect on itself with a successful DC 23 Intelligence saving throw. A target that succeeds on the saving throw becomes immune to Isperia's Supreme Legal Authority for 24 hours.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Isperia casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from her list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.
