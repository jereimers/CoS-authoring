## Traits

**Disarming Charm.** While Forge isn't wearing armor, his AC includes his Charisma modifier.

**Double-Cross.** If Forge hits a creature friendly to him with an attack roll, the attack is automatically a critical hit.

**Evasion.** If Forge is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails, provided he isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Forge makes two Dagger attacks, two Heavy Crossbow attacks, or one of each.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage plus 24 (**7d6**) poison damage, and the target is [[poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.

**Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage plus 24 (**7d6**) poison damage. @homIf the target is a creature, it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of Forge's next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Cunning.** Forge takes the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action, or he gives himself advantage on the next attack roll he makes before the end of this turn.


## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** Forge halves the damage he takes from an attack that hits him. He must be able to see the attacker.
