# What the party knows

## Portrait

## Roleplaying Information

### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Muriel is a cheerful, if occasionally scatterbrained young woman. To those she trusts, Muriel is a determined field agent for the Keepers of the Feather, with a strong sense of justice and a fierce independent streak. Deep down, Muriel is still grieving the death of her fiancé, Elric Martikov, and wonders whether she'll ever fix what his death broke inside of her.

### Morale
In a fight, Muriel would gladly pull out her shortsword or crossbow and dare her opponent to strike first, fleeing only if her regeneration were blocked or outmatched.

### Relationships
Muriel is an agent of the Keepers of the Feather under [[Davian Martikov]], a contact and ally of Keeper spymaster [[Urwin Martikov]], and the once-fiancé of Davian's deceased son, Elric Martikov, who was imprisoned while assisting Doru's rebellion against Castle Ravenloft.
