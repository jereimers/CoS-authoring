# Poisoner

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Potent Poison

When you make a damage roll that deals Poison damage, it ignores [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Poison damage.

## Brew Poison

You gain proficiency with the [[Poisoner's Kit|XPHB]]. With 1 hour of work using such a kit and expending 50 GP worth of materials, you can create a number of poison doses equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]. As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can apply a poison dose to a weapon or piece of ammunition. Once applied, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you deal damage with the poisoned item, whichever is shorter. When a creature takes damage from the poisoned item, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the modifier of the ability increased by this feat and your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or take **2d8** Poison damage and have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition until the end of your next turn.
