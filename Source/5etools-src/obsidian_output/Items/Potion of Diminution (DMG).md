# Potion of Diminution

*Item, Rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the [[enlarge/reduce]] spell for `1d4` hours (no [[concentration]] required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
