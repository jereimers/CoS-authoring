## Traits

**Turn Immunity.** The eye of fear and flame is immune to effects that turn undead.

**Multiattack.** The eye of fear and flame makes two claw attacks and uses its Gemstone Eyes.

**Gemstone Eyes.** The eye of fear and flame shoots one of the following magical eye rays, choosing one target it can see within 90 feet of it.

- **Eye of Fear:** The target and up to four other creatures of the eye of fear and flame's choice within 10 feet of the target must each succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A target that ignites takes 5 (**1d10**) fire damage at the start of each of its turns until a creature takes an action to douse the fire.
