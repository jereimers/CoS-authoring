## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede Abigor's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance.** Abigor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Abigor makes four attacks using its Warhammer, Throwing Hammer, or a combination of the two.

**Warhammer.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (**1d6**) thunder damage.

**Throwing Hammer.** Ranged Weapon Attack +15 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (**1d6**) thunder damage. Hammers thrown this way fall and stick into the ground after hitting their target and a new hammer appears in Abigor's hand.

**Thunderous Slam {@recharge 5}.** Abigor causes all its hammers left on the battlefield to bristle with thunderous energy, exploding outwards with a roar. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on each hammer must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. Targets take 26 (**4d12**) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is within multiple spheres, it must make the save multiple times, taking damage from each source.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Throw Hammer.** Abigor makes a Throwing Hammer attack.

**Call Thunder (Costs 2 Actions).** Abigor targets a hammer that it can see within 60 feet to let out a thunderous roar. Creatures within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the hammer must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 26 (**4d12**) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
