## Traits

**Diabolical Sense.** The narzugon has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks made to perceive good-aligned creatures.

**Infernal Tack.** The narzugon wears spurs that are part of infernal tack, which allow it to summon its [[nightmare]] companion.

**Magic Resistance.** The narzugon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The narzugon uses its Infernal Command or Terrifying Command. It also makes three hellfire lance attacks.

**Hellfire Lance.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d12 + 5**) piercing damage plus 16 (**3d10**) fire damage. If this damage kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a lemure in Avernus in `1d4` hours.

If the creature isn't revived before then, only a [[wish]] spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.

**Infernal Command.** Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of it can't be [[charmed]] or [[frightened]] until the end of the narzugon's next turn.

**Terrifying Command.** Each creature that isn't a fiend within 60 feet of the narzugon that can hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become [[frightened]] of it for 1 minute.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon's Terrifying Command for 24 hours.

**Healing (1/Day).** The narzugon, or one creature it touches, regains up to 100 hit points.
