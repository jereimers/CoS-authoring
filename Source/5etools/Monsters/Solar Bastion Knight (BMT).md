## Traits

**Aura of Protection.** The knight and each ally within 10 feet of it have advantage on saving throws. This trait is suppressed while the knight has the [[incapacitated]] condition.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The knight makes three Sunspear attacks.

**Sunspear.** Attack (ms,rs) +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) radiant damage, or 21 (**5d6 + 4**) radiant damage if the target is a Fiend or an Undead.

**Solar Flare {@recharge 5}.** The knight unleashes a blaze of brilliant energy that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the knight. Each creature of the knight's choice in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (**4d10**) radiant damage and has the [[blinded]] condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. For the next minute, the affected area is filled with bright light that is sunlight.
