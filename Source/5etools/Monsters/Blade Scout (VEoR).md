## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** The scout has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the scout's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The scout makes three Armblade or Bolt Launcher attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with a use of Snare Trap.

**Armblade.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Bolt Launcher.** Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) piercing damage.

**Snare Trap (1/Day).** The scout deploys a Tiny mechanical trap on a solid surface within 5 feet of itself. The trap is hidden, requiring a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to find. The trap lasts for 1 minute. Whenever an enemy enters a space within 10 feet of the trap or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (**6d6**) piercing damage and have the [[prone]] condition. A creature makes this saving throw only once per turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Dash.** The scout moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
