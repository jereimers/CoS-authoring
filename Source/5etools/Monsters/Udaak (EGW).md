## Traits

**Charge.** If the udaak moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a slam attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 27 (**6d8**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away from the udaak and knocked [[prone]].

**Siege Monster.** The udaak deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The udaak makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its slam.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h21 (**2d12 + 8**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 21). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the udaak can't bite another target.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.

**Swallow.** The udaak makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the udaak, and it takes 21 (**6d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the udaak's turns.

If the udaak takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the udaak must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the udaak. If the udaak dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
