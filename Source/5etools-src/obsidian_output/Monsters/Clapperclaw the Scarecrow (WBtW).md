## Actions

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**2d4 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Stuffing.** Clapperclaw stuffs straw or other dead plant matter into itself and regains `2d4 + 2` hit points. Roll a `d6`; on a 1 or 2, Clapperclaw runs out of stuffing and must spend 8 hours foraging for more before it can use this action again.
