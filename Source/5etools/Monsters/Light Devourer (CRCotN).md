## Traits

**Light Absorption.** If the light devourer spends any part of its turn in an area of bright light or is subjected to radiant damage, it radiates dim light in a 10-foot radius for 1 hour.

**Water Breathing.** The light devourer can breathe only underwater.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The light devourer makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h21 (**5d6 + 4**) piercing damage, or radiant damage if the light devourer is radiating light (see Light Absorption).


## Bonus Actions

**Radiant Discharge.** If the light devourer is radiating light (see Light Absorption), it releases the light stored in its body in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on itself, then ceases to radiate light. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (**7d6**) radiant damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
