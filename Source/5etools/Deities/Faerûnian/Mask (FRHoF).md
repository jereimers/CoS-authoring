# Mask

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Mask is a trickster god, the patron of ne'er-do-wells, spies, and thieves. All that occurs within shadow is in the purview of Mask. People whisper a prayer to Mask whenever stealth is required or intrigue is afoot. Courtiers and diplomats invoke Mask's name in hope of a smooth negotiation.

Mask takes the form of a quick masculine being wielding two shadowy blades, his identity hidden by a mask. Sometimes he takes the form of masks that others might wear. When he speaks to his followers, he does so by claiming a mask as his temporary face, or he sends a living shadow (Neutral Evil [[Shadow Demon|XMM]]).

Those who favor Mask practice thievery and try to acquire what belongs to others, engaging in pickpocketing, burglary, mugging, and con games. Ordinary folk pray to him so he'll avert his eyes from their valuables, but cautious individuals employ "Mask's purse," a small, cheap cloth pouch worn in plain sight containing a small offering of coin. By convention, a pickpocket pilfers Mask's purse when encountering another person wearing one and considers it a gift from the god, while the one who lost the purse is grateful to Mask for accepting this respectful sacrifice. Of course, nothing prevents another pickpocket from targeting someone who has lost Mask's purse, and anyone with the ill luck to attract multiple pickpockets in a single outing has probably earned Mask's ire anyway.

Priests of Mask are thieves by profession and serve as higher-ups in the local underworld or a criminal syndicate. They go by the title of demarche and wear veil-masks when acting in their priestly capacity.

The foremost organization serving Mask is the Shadowmasters of Telflamm, a criminal syndicate in the land of [[Thesk|FRHoF]]. The Shadowmasters are based at Mask's largest temple, the House of Shadow, in Telflamm, but they also maintain safe houses throughout Thesk.

Chosen of Mask are master thieves, manipulative spies, and assassins who rarely walk in the light.
