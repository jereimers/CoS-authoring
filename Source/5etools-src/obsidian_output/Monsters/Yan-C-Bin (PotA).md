## Traits

**Air Form.** Yan-C-Bin can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. He can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing if air could pass through that space.

**Empowered Attacks.** Yan-C-Bin's slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Yan-C-Bin fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Yan-C-Bin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Yan-C-Bin makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) force damage plus 10 (**3d6**) lightning damage.

**Thundercrack (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Yan-C-Bin unleashes a terrible thundercrack in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on himself. All other creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 31 (**9d6**) thunder damage and be [[deafened]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is [[deafened]] until the start of Yan-C-Bin's next turn.

**Change Shape.** Yan-C-Bin polymorphs into a Medium humanoid. While in polymorphed form, a swirling breeze surrounds him, his eyes are pale and cloudy, and he loses the Air Form trait. He can remain in polymorphed form for up to 1 hour. Reverting to his true form requires an action.

**Summon Elementals (1/Day).** Yan-C-Bin summons up to three [[air elemental|]] and loses 30 hit points for each elemental he summons. Summoned elementals have maximum hit points, appear within 100 feet of Yan-C-Bin, and disappear if Yan-C-Bin is reduced to 0 hit points.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Peal of Thunder.** Yan-C-Bin unleashes a peal of thunder that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. Each creature within 30 feet of Yan-C-Bin takes 5 (**1d10**) thunder damage.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** Yan-C-Bin magically teleports up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Anything Yan-C-Bin is wearing or carrying is teleported with him.

**Suffocate (Costs 3 Actions).** Yan-C-Bin steals the air of one breathing creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target drops to 0 hit points and is dying. On a successful save, the target can't breathe or speak until the start of its next turn.
