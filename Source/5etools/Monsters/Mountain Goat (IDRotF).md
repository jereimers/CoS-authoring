## Traits

**Charge.** If the goat moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Sure-Footed.** The goat has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [[prone]].


## Actions

**Ram.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.
