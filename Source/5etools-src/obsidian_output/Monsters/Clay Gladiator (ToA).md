## Traits

**Climbing.** The gladiator can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Steadfast.** The gladiator can't be disarmed, and cannot make ranged attacks.

**Brute.** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the gladiator hits with it (included in the attack).


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The gladiator makes three melee attacks.

**Spear.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) piercing damage, or 13 (**2d8 + 4**) piercing damage if used with two hands.

**Shield Bash.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].



## Reactions

**Parry.** The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
