# Staff of Defense

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This slender, hollow staff is made of glass yet is as strong as oak. It weighs 3 pounds. While holding the staff, you have a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.

## Spells

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can expend the requisite number of charges to cast one of the following spells from the staff: [[mage armor]] (1 charge) or [[shield]] (2 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff shatters and is destroyed.
