## Traits

**Foul Ichor.** A creature that hits Miska with a melee weapon attack takes 7 (**2d6**) poison damage.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Miska fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Miska has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** Miska can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** When in contact with a web, Miska knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** Miska ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Miska makes one Lupine Bite attack and two Trident of Chaos attacks.

**Lupine Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 27 (**6d8**) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, a creature has the [[incapacitated]] condition and can't regain hit points. A [[poisoned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Trident of Chaos.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) force damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Demand Loyalty.** Miska magically ends the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions on himself and on any of his allies within 120 feet of himself.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Howl.** Miska utters a bloodthirsty howl at one creature within 120 feet of himself that isn't a Fiend. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or take 13 (**2d12**) psychic damage.

**Skitter.** Miska moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Miska uses Spellcasting.
