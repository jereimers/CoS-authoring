# Cold Caster

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Cantrip

You learn the [[Ray of Frost|XPHB]] cantrip. If you already know it, you learn a different Wizard cantrip of your choice. The spell's spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

## Frostbite

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal Cold damage, you can temporarily negate the creature's defenses. The creature subtracts `1d4` from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.
