# Charm of the Moon

*Charm*

As an action, you make a minor wish. When you do, you create the effects of a spell of 5th level or lower. The spell takes effect as part of this action and requires no spell components. Your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is the spellcasting ability for this spell (your choice). Once you use this charm, it vanishes from you.
