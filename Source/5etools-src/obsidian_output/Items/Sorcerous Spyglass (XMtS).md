# Sorcerous Spyglass

*Item, Unknown (Magic)*

This elegant brass [[spyglass|phb]] features an intricate lens mechanism. A creature looking through the sorcerous spyglass has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks to detect things that can be seen. In addition, the user can view magical auras while looking through the spyglass, as if under the effect of a [[detect magic]] spell.
