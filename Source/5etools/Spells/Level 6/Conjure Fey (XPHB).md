# Conjure Fey

*6th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

You conjure a Medium spirit from the Feywild in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The spirit lasts for the duration, and it looks like a Fey creature of your choice. When the spirit appears, you can make one melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes Psychic damage equal to **3d12** plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and the target has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the start of your next turn, with both you and the spirit as the source of the fear.

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] on your later turns, you can teleport the spirit to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of the space it left and make the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d12` for each spell slot level above 6.
