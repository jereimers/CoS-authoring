## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** The heir has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the heir's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The heir makes four attacks, using Scimitar or Lunar Wisp in any combination.

**Scimitar.** m +5, reach 5 ft. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) Slashing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) Poison damage.

**Lunar Wisp.** r +5, range 60 ft. @h9 (**2d8**) Radiant damage, and the target emits [[Dim Light|XPHB]] in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition until the end of the heir's next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Spur Beast.** The heir targets a Beast it can see within 30 feet. The target can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to move up to half its [[Speed|XPHB]] and make one melee attack.
