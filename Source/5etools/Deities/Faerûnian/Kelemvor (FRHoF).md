# Kelemvor

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Kelemvor is the just, fair, and comforting god of death. When death occurs, Kelemvor takes a soul by the hand and leads it to the proper afterlife. Death isn't a thing to be feared in Kelemvor's eyes, but a natural part of life that must be accepted in its time. When Kelemvor speaks to his worshipers, he does so in dreams appearing as a silver-haired man wearing black, hooded robes and a silver funeral mask, or he speaks through the body of a person who recently died.

Priests of Kelemvor—the most elite of whom are known as doomguides—provide people with peaceful transitions into death. Priests sort the dying's affairs, counsel bereaved mourners, and officiate funeral rites. The tenets of Kelemvor's faith compel his followers to forestall or prevent untimely deaths whenever possible, and to eliminate the scourge of the undead. Several organizations outside the formal priesthood focus on these tenets in different ways. The Vital Breath concentrates on stopping the spread of plagues and magical contagions, the Judge's Vigil focuses on the prevention of murder, and the Knights of the Eternal Order search for and destroy powerful undead.

Their vehement opposition to undead puts Kelemvor's followers at odds with necromancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who create undead, but it also causes conflict in unexpected ways. For instance, priests of Kelemvor routinely destroy writings about the creation of undead—an act that offends those who value knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of Oghma and Deneir. Undead of good alignment exist, but Kelemvor's devotees seek even their destruction.

Chosen of Kelemvor embody the natural course of death and are optimistic and jubilant. They rejoice in the thriving of life in its time and can resurrect the victims of improper deaths.

## Knights of the Eternal Order

The Knights of the Eternal Order hunts undead in the name of Kelemvor and in defense of the natural order of life and death. While most members of the Eternal Order are battle-skilled warriors or priests, anyone with the courage to oppose undead is welcome.

Prospective knights join the order as aspirants and serve an established knight as a squire or warrior at arms. The knight oversees the aspirant's training and measures their suitability over time, leading them on quests in Kelemvor's name or sending the aspirant forth to serve. Adventurers might prove their worth on such endeavors.

To be knighted, the aspirant must show courage by destroying a dangerous undead. Those who are found worthy swear an oath to the order and receive a suit of black armor (as Kelemvor wore in his mortal days) or a silver-trimmed black tabard or robe marked with Kelemvor's holy symbol. (If your campaign uses renown, a character must also have a Renown Score of 3+ with the Knights of the Eternal Order to be knighted.)

Knights of the Eternal Order learn to identify and destroy Undead creatures, and they study divine magic and fighting prowess. Knights receive a free Comfortable lifestyle at any temple of Kelemvor. Knights can call on the aid of a [[Priest|XMM]] of Kelemvor during a quest in service to the order.

The Knights of the Eternal Order allies with followers of Helm, Lathander, and Mystra to oppose undead. Its chief foe is Cyric and his followers, although the Knights of the Undying Dragon (an order of [[Death Knight|XMM]]) draws the Eternal Order's ire and attention.
