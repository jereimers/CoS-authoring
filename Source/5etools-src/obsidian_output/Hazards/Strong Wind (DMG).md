# Strong Wind

A strong wind imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on hearing. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes disadvantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.
