# Philter of Love

*Item, Uncommon*

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you are [[charmed|XPHB]] by that creature and have the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition for 1 hour.

This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
