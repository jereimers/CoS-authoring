# Who they are

Madam Eva is the ancient and revered seer of the [[Vistani]], residing at the [[Tser Pool Encampment]]. She possesses the gift of foresight and reads the Tarokka—a mystical deck of cards that reveals glimpses of fate and fortune. Though her age is beyond reckoning, her mind remains sharp and her counsel invaluable to those brave enough to seek it.

# What the party knows

- Madam Eva warned the party of the severity of their quest, noting that countless others who attempted to oppose [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] met a terminal fate
- She sensed "a shadow approaching her tent"—a servant of Darkness seeking knowledge of the party's future—and postponed their Tarokka reading until midnight at the [[River Ivlis Crossroads|crossroads]] cemetery
- At the cemetery, she showed the party the [[03 - Village of Barovia - March of the Dead|March of the Dead]]—the nightly procession of ghostly heroes slain by Strahd, doomed to reenact their deaths at Castle Ravenloft
- She performed [[The Tarokka Reading]] for the party, revealing cryptic clues about artifacts and allies that could help them defeat Strahd
- She asked the party to deliver a toy from [[Blinsky Toys]] to her great-grand-niece [[Arabelle]] at the [[Vistani Camp]] southwest of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] by noon on the girl's name-day
- She suggested the party would enjoy meeting [[Arabelle]]'s father [[Luvash]] and his brother [[Arrigal]]

# Personality

- Speaks with the solemn authority of one who has witnessed centuries of suffering
- Alternates between cryptic wisdom and surprisingly direct warnings
- Shows genuine concern for those who seek to oppose Strahd, extracting solemn oaths of commitment before offering her aid
- Possesses an intimate knowledge of visitors' pasts that is both unsettling and reassuring
