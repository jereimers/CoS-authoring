## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the rocking horse is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the rocking horse move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the rocking horse is animate.

**Flying Mount.** The rocking horse can serve as a mount for a Medium or smaller creature and can fly only while mounted.

**Unusual Nature.** The rocking horse doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep, and it regains no hit points or Hit Dice at the end of a long rest.


## Actions

**Head Butt.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage.
