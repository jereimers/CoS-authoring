You create a twisting pattern of colors in a 30-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who can see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition for the duration. While [[Charmed|XPHB]], the creature has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition and a [[Speed|XPHB]] of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
