# K32. Maid in Hell

<div class="description"><p>Oil lamps illuminate this long, rectangular chamber with oak-paneled walls. Stained, yellowed lace hangs neatly from eight canopied beds. The figure of a woman moves lithely about the room, dusting furniture and humming quietly. Around her pale, slender neck is a gold necklace with a ruby pendant.</p></div>

The maid, Helga Ruvak, is a vampire spawn who claims to be the daughter of the village bootmaker, kidnapped and forced into service by Strahd. She pleads, on her hands and knees if necessary, to be saved from this awful place.

Helga will join the party if the characters ask her along. She intends to attack the characters but does so only if she senses an opportunity that doesn't involve having to fight the entire party. She also attacks if commanded to do so by Strahd.

Helga plays the part of the innocent damsel in distress to the last, revealing her ferocity only when she attacks. She is, in fact, the bootmaker's daughter she claims to be, but she chose a life of evil with Strahd.

## Treasure

Helga's gold necklace with its ruby pendant is a gift from Strahd. The necklace is almost five centuries old and is worth 750 gp .
