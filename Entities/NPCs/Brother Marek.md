# Brother Marek
In death, Brother Marek is a cold, apathetic shell of a man. His once-jovial cheer has wizened to a dry, sarcastic cynicism, and he views the Order’s fates as damnation for their failures. However, he is not without compassion, and truly wishes the players nothing but the best—so long as they abandon their foolish efforts to stir up the spirits of Argynvostholt. Brother Marek’s spirit should make the players feel irritated, insulted, and sympathetic, and most often feels melancholy, annoyed, skeptical, bitter, resigned, bemused, or disapproving.
