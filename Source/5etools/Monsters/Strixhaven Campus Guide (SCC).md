## Traits

**Campus Knowledge.** While at Strixhaven, the guide can't become lost by magical or nonmagical means. The guide also has advantage on ability checks made to locate creatures or objects at Strixhaven.

**Univocal Speech.** When the guide speaks, any creature that knows at least one language and can hear the guide understands what it says.

**Unusual Nature.** The guide doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The guide makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Smile and Wave.** Each creature of the guide's choice that is within 30 feet of the guide must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[charmed]] by the guide for 1 hour.

A [[charmed]] target must move on its turn toward the guide, trying to get within 5 feet of the guide. The target doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. Whenever the [[charmed]] target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A target that successfully saves is immune to any guide's Smile and Wave ability for the next 24 hours.


## Bonus Actions

**Need Directions.** The guide takes the Help action.
