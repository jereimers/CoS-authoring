## Traits

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the mutate has disadvantage on attack rolls.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The mutate makes two Unarmed Strike or Nightmare Blast attacks.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.

**Nightmare Blast.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. @h7 (**2d6**) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[frightened]] condition until the start of the mutate's next turn.



## Reactions

**Defensive Flight.** Immediately after taking damage, the mutate flies up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
