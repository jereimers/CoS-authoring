# Alustriel's Mooncloak

*5th-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** {'type': 'emanation', 'distance': {'type': 'feet', 'amount': 20}}  
**Components:** V, S, M (a moonstone worth 50+ GP)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

For the duration, moonlight fills a 20-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you with [[Dim Light|XPHB]]. While in that area, you and your allies have [[Cover|XPHB]] and [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Cold, Lightning, and Radiant damage.

While the spell lasts, you can use one of the following options, ending the spell immediately:

- **Liberation:** When you fail a saving throw to avoid or end the [[Frightened|XPHB]], [[Grappled|XPHB]], or [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to succeed on the save instead.
- **Respite:** As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you or an ally within the area regains [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to `4d10` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
