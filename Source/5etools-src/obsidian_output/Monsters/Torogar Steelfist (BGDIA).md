**Labyrinthine Recall.** Torogar can perfectly recall any path he has traveled.

**Rage (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** As a bonus action, Torogar can enter a rage that lasts for 1 minute. The rage ends early if Torogar is knocked [[unconscious]] or if his turn ends and he hasn't attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since his last turn. While raging, Torogar gains the following benefits:

He deals an extra 3 damage when he hits a target with a melee weapon attack.

He has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
