# Knave's Eye Patch

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this eye patch, you gain these benefits:

- You have advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.
- If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait.
- You are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts or determine whether you are lying. Creatures can communicate telepathically with you only if you allow it.
