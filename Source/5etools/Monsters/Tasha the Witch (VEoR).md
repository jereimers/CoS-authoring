## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Tasha fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Tasha has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. (This trait is bestowed by her Robe of the Archmagi.)

**Special Equipment.** Tasha wears a [[Robe of the Archmagi]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Tasha makes two Caustic Blast attacks and uses Psychic Whip once.

**Caustic Blast.** Attack (ms,rs) +14 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h21 (**6d4 + 6**) acid damage.

**Psychic Whip.** Tasha psychically lashes out at one creature she can see within 90 feet of herself. The target must make a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 21 (**6d6**) psychic damage and has the [[stunned]] condition until the start of Tasha's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.


## Bonus Actions

**Abyssal Visage (2/Day).** For 1 minute, Tasha gains a flying speed of 30 feet, is immune to poison damage and the [[poisoned]] condition, and has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points. These benefits end early if Tasha has the [[incapacitated]] condition or if she uses another bonus action to dismiss them.


## Reactions

**Arcane Rebuff.** Immediately after Tasha takes damage, she unleashes arcane energy in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on herself. All other creatures in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 19 (**3d12**) lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Tasha then teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space she can see within 60 feet of herself.
