## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Nightmare Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a cloud of spores in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (**1d10**) psychic damage, and it is [[frightened]] of the dragon for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
