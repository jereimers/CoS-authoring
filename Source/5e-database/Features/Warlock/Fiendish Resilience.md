# Fiendish Resilience

**Class:** [[Warlock]]  
**Level:** 10

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.
