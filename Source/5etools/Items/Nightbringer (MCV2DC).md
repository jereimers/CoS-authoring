# Nightbringer

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

This heavy mace has a dark oaken handle and a head of blackened steel trimmed with gold. In combat, the mace's head is wreathed in inky black energy.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an additional **4d4** radiant damage.

If you have an evil alignment, you also gain the following benefits when attuned to Nightbringer:

## Blessing of the Dragon Queen

You are immune to the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions, and you gain immunity to one of the following damage types (choose when you attune to the weapon): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

## Eyes of Midnight

You have [[darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [[darkvision]], its range increases by 60 feet.

## Midnight Shroud

The weapon has 6 charges. When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can expend one charge to force the creature to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[blinded]] until the start of your next turn. The weapon regains `1d6` expended charges daily at dawn.
