## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ervan uses his staff to make three Arcane Blast attacks.

**Arcane Blast.** Attack (ms,rs) +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) force damage.

**Acid Rain (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Acid falls in a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on a point Ervan can see within 120 feet of himself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
