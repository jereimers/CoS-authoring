## Traits

**Invisibility Field.** The orthon can use a bonus action to become [[invisible]]. Any equipment the orthon wears or carries is also [[invisible]] as long as the equipment is on its person. This invisibility ends immediately after the orthon makes an attack roll or is hit by an attack.

**Magic Resistance.** The orthon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Infernal Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d4 + 6**) slashing damage, and the target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failure, the target is [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The [[poisoned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Brass Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) piercing damage, plus one of the following effects:

- **1. Acid:** The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an additional 17 (**5d6**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **2. Blindness (1/Day):** The target takes 5 (**1d10**) radiant damage. In addition, the target and all other creatures within 20 feet of it must each make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the end of the orthon's next turn.
- **3. Concussion:** The target and each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (**2d12**) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **4. Entanglement:** The target must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be [[restrained]] for 1 hour by strands of sticky webbing. A [[restrained]] creature can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 17 Dexterity or Strength check. Any creature other than an orthon that touches the [[restrained]] creature must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or become similarly [[restrained]].
- **5. Paralysis (1/Day):** The target takes 22 (**4d10**) lightning damage and must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The [[paralyzed]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **6. Tracking:** For the next 24 hours, the orthon knows the direction and distance to the target, as long as it's on the same plane of existence. If the target is on a different plane, the orthon knows which one, but not the exact location there.



## Reactions

**Explosive Retribution.** When it is reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, the orthon causes itself to explode. All other creatures within 30 feet of it must each make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (**2d8**) fire damage plus 9 (**2d8**) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This explosion destroys the orthon, its infernal dagger, and its brass crossbow.
