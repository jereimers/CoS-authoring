## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Jon Irenicus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Rejuvenation.** If he has a phylactery and he is destroyed, Jon Irenicus gains a new body in `1d10` days, regaining all his hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.

**Special Equipment.** Jon Irenicus carries a [[rod of lordly might]]. He can use a bonus action to switch it between its [[Mace|PHB]] and [[Flame Tongue]] attacks.

**Turn Resistance.** Jon Irenicus has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns Undead.


## Actions

**Multiattack (only useable with Transformation).** Jon Irenicus makes two Flame Tongue attacks or two Mace attacks. Each attack is made with advantage and does an additional 13 (**2d12**) force damage if it hits.

**Flame Tongue (Rod of Lordly Might).** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d8 + 7**) slashing damage and 7 (**2d6**) fire damage.

**Mace (Rod of Lordly Might).** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d6 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.

**Breath of Death (1/Day).** Jon Irenicus emits a 90-foot cone of necrotic energy. Each creature in the effects area must make a DC 21 saving throw, taking 55 (**10d10**) necrotic damage on a failed save, half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Draining Counterspell.** Jon Irenicus interrupts a creature he can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 4th level or higher, Jon Irenicus makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster takes 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage if the spell fails.


## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Drain Life (1/Day).** Jon Irenicus makes a drain life attack with his rod of lordly might. If he hits a creature with his rod, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes an extra 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage, and Jon regains a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage.

**Paralyze (1/Day).** Jon Irenicus makes a paralyze attack with his rod of lordly might. If he hits a creature with his rod, the creature must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[paralyzed]] condition for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Jon Irenicus uses Spellcasting.

**Transformation (Costs 3 Actions).** Jon Irenicus becomes endowed with endurance and martial prowess for 1 minute or until he ends this effect by using a bonus action. While transformed, he gains 50 temporary hit points, proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throw, adds his Multiattack feature, and loses his Draining Counterspell reaction and Spellcasting action.
