## Traits

**Lightning Absorption.** Whenever the skitterwidget is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

**Unusual Nature.** The skitterwidget doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The skitterwidget makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] by the skitterwidget (escape DC 13).

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) lightning damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn.



## Reactions

**Good Parent.** The skitterwidget imposes disadvantage on one attack roll made against a kiddywidget it can see within 5 feet of it.
