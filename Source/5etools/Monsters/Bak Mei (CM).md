## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Bak Mei fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Special Equipment.** Bak Mei carries a [[staff of striking]] with 10 charges.

**Unarmored Defense.** While Bak Mei is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, his AC includes his Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Bak Mei attacks three times: twice with Thunder Strike and once with his staff of striking.

**Thunder Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) thunder damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[deafened]] and [[stunned]] until the start of Bak Mei's next turn.

**Staff of Striking.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage, or 4 (**1d8**) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands, and Bak Mei can expend up to 3 of the staff's charges. For each expended charge, the target takes an extra **1d6** force damage.

**Heal Self (Recharges after a Long Rest).** Bak Mei regains `2d8 + 4` hit points, and all levels of [[exhaustion]] end on him.


## Bonus Actions

## Reactions

**Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, Bak Mei deflects the missile. The damage he takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 12`. If the damage is reduced to 0, Bak Mei catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and Bak Mei has a hand free.
