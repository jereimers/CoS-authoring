## Traits

**Bonding.** The hawk can magically bond with one creature it can see, immediately after spending at least 1 hour observing that creature while within 30 feet of it. The bond lasts until the hawk bonds with a different creature or until the bonded creature dies. While bonded, the hawk and the bonded creature can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 100 feet.

**Keen Sight.** The hawk has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) slashing damage.
