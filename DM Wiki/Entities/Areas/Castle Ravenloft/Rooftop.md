# K53. Rooftop

Rain splashes against the sagging, sloping rooftop. Flashes of lightning illuminate gargoyles perched on the roof's end peaks, their hideous stares forever fixed on the courtyard some one hundred thirty feet below.

If a character tries to traverse the rooftop, read:

%% --- Page 96 --- %%
Some of the ancient roof tiles slide easily underfoot, easily dropping into the fog-shrouded darkness. Each falling tile resounds with a hollow click as it hits the flagstones of the parapet or courtyard below.

A character must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to traverse the roof. The check succeeds automatically if the character crawls. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character slides off the edge of the roof ans falls 40 feet to the castle parapet (area K46).
