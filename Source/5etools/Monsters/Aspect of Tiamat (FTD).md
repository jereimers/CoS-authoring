## Traits

**Chromatic Wrath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the aspect would be reduced to 0 hit points, her current hit point total instead resets to 500 hit points, she recharges her Chromatic Flames, and she regains any expended uses of Legendary Resistance. Additionally, the aspect can now use the options in the "Mythic Actions" section for 1 hour. Award a party an additional 155,000 XP (310,000 XP total) for defeating the aspect of Tiamat after her Chromatic Wrath activates.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If the aspect fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The aspect makes one Bite attack, one Claw attack, and one Tail attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h23 (**2d12 + 10**) piercing damage plus 19 (**3d12**) force damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h21 (**2d10 + 10**) slashing damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 20) and is [[restrained]] until this grapple ends. The aspect can have only one creature [[grappled]] this way at a time.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h23 (**2d12 + 10**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 27 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Chromatic Flames {@recharge 5}.** The aspect exhales multicolored flames in a 300-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 71 (**11d12**) damage of a type of the aspect's choosing: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** The aspect makes one Claw or Tail attack.

**Furious Bite (Costs 2 Actions).** The aspect makes one Bite attack. If the attack hits a creature, the target must succeed on a DC 27 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of the aspect until the end of its next turn.
