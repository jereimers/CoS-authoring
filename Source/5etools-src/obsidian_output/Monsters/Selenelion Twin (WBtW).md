## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The Selenelion twins, Gleam and Glister, have advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put them to sleep.

**Regeneration.** A Selenelion twin regains 5 hit points at the start of her turn as long as both twins are alive and within 60 feet of each other. A twin dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Twin Bond.** While both Selenelion twins are alive and on the same plane of existence, each is aware of the other's emotions.


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Moon Ray (Gleam Only; 3/Day).** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed into a bat for 1 minute, as though affected by a [[polymorph]] spell. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Sun Ray (Glister Only; 3/Day).** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) radiant damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[blinded]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Twin Sight (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** In her mind's eye, a Selenelion twin can see what the other twin sees for up to 1 minute, provided both twins are alive and on the same plane of existence. Maintaining this effect requires [[concentration]] (as if [[concentration]] on a spell).
