# Boon of Misty Escape

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Gaseous Form

If you drop to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] but aren't killed outright, you can instead drop to 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] and cast [[Gaseous Form|XPHB]] without expending a spell slot (no action required). When you cast this spell this way, you can target only yourself, your [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] is 20 feet, and you regain 10 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] at the start of each of your turns for the spell's duration. The spell's spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
