# Ireena Kolyana Profile

## Portrait
![[ireena-kolyana.png]]

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Ireena should inspire flattery with her genuine interest in the players' goals and interests, sympathy for her sense of guilt and fear of Strahd, endearment for her determination to continue moving forward, and gratitude for her efforts to help the players succeed.

### Emotions
Ireena most often feels curious, thoughtful, melancholy, guilty, stubborn, joyful, determined, defiant, and anxious.

### Motivations
Ireena wants to keep her fellow Barovians and Ismark safe, honor her parents' memory, learn new stories, and one day explore distant lands.

### Inspirations
When playing Ireena, channel Belle (Beauty and the Beast), Elizabeth Swann (Pirates of the Caribbean), Eowyn (Lord of the Rings), Hermione Granger (Harry Potter), and Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games).

### Vocal Notes
Barovian/Eastern European accent.

### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Ireena is a compassionate, curious, yet stubborn young noblewoman. To those she trusts, Ireena is an anxious, yet determined young woman who dreams of freedom and adventure. Deep down, Ireena wonders whether giving herself up to Strahd would be the best way to protect those she loves.

### Morale
In a fight, Ireena will always turn to words before a sword. If necessary to defend herself, though, she'll draw her rapier—reluctantly, if protecting herself, and proudly, if protecting another.

### Relationships
Ireena is the (knowing) adopted sister of Ismark Kolyanovich, the (unknowing) sister of Izek Strazni, and the (unknowing) reincarnation of Tatyana Federovna.
