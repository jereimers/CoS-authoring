## Traits

**Labyrinthine Recall.** The stalker can perfectly recall any path it has traveled.

**Magic Resistance.** The stalker has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The stalker makes two Glaive attacks or two Rock attacks.

**Glaive.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h18 (**2d10 + 7**) slashing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) force damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +11 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h23 (**3d10 + 7**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition. After the stalker throws the rock, roll a `d6`; on a roll of 3 or lower, the stalker has no more rocks to throw.

**Erupting Horns {@recharge 5}.** The stalker causes the earth to churn at a point on the ground it can see within 60 feet of itself. Six horn-shaped stones erupt in a 30-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point and then crumble to dust.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (**6d10**) piercing damage and is pushed up to 30 feet upward and then falls. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
