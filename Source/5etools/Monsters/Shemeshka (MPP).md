## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If Shemeshka fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Shemeshka has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Special Equipment.** Shemeshka carries a magic crown called the Razorvine Tiara. In the hands of anyone other than Shemeshka, the Razorvine Tiara functions as a [[tentacle rod]] that deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Shemeshka uses Arcane Flux or Spellcasting. She then makes one Claw attack or one attack with her Razorvine Tiara.

**Arcane Flux.** Shemeshka causes a surge of arcane energy to burst around one creature she can see within 120 feet of herself. The target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 45 (**7d12**) force damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d4 + 5**) slashing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) poison damage.

**Razorvine Tiara.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d6**) slashing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Teleport.** Shemeshka teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.


## Reactions

**Fell Counterspell (3/Day).** Shemeshka utters a magical word to interrupt a creature she can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 5th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 6th level or higher, Shemeshka makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster gains the [[poisoned]] condition until the end of its next turn.
