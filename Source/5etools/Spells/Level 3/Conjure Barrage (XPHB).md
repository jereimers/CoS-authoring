# Conjure Barrage

*3rd-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (60-feet cone)  
**Components:** V, S, M (a Melee or Ranged weapon worth at least 1 CP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You brandish the weapon used to cast the spell and conjure similar spectral weapons (or ammunition appropriate to the weapon) that launch forward and then disappear. Each creature of your choice that you can see in a 60-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **5d8** Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `5d8` for each spell slot level above 3.
