# Cubic Gate

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the DM.

The cube has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can expend 1 of the cube's charges to cast one of the following spells using the cube.

## Gate

Pressing one side of the cube, you cast [[Gate|XPHB]], opening a portal to the plane of existence keyed to that side.

## Plane Shift

Pressing one side of the cube twice, you cast [[Plane Shift|XPHB]], transporting the targets to the plane of existence keyed to that side.
