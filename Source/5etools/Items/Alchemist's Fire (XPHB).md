# Alchemist's Fire

*Item, None*

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a flask of Alchemist's Fire. Target one creature or object you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or take **1d4** Fire damage and start [[burning|XPHB]].
