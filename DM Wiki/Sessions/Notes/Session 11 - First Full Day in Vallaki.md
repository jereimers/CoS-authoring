Note that Ireena will want to speak with the Baron as described in [[Act II Summary#^Abstract-Ireenas-Diplomacy|Ireena's Diplomacy]] -- something else that they'll need to work into the schedule for the day. 

# First evening (Neyavr 3)
This night, they'll receive Lady Wachter's invitation, delivered by Ernst Larnak.


It's also possible that Ireena can speak with the Baron when the party goes to visit the mansion to investigate the signet ring in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E3. Burgomaster’s Mansion|Arc E]].

# Arabelle sequence

This begins when the players take the toy they purchased from Blinsky to the Vistani Camp, a half-hour's walk southwest of the village.

1. Read the description of the Vistani Camp ([[05_Chapter 5 - The Town of Vallaki#N9. Vistani Camp|WOTC]]) and offer them a choice -- up the hill, or speak to one fo the guards
2. **If up the hill:** [[E2a - The Vistani Encampment]], read what's happening in the tent, and the players have a conversation with Luvash, and he asks them for help with the ring, and he sends them to Kasimir to retrieve it.
	1. **Investigate the site of her disappearance?** if the party wants to track Arabelle from the site of her disappearance, allow them to do it but be mindful of the time of day. If it's nighttime, run a random encounter when they reach [[02_Chapter 2 - The Lands of Barovia#P. Luna River Crossroads|P. Luna River Crossroads]]
3. **If speak to guard:** They can direct the players up the hill (if they inquire about the Vistani) or to Kasimir's hovel. If Kasimir, they note that Kasimir has recently returned from a long and arduous journey and that the players must not disturb him beyond what is reasonably necessary.
4. [[E2c - Kasimir’s Hovel]] - read the description! Then introduce Kasimir "sitting on the green rug facing the fire, meditating". He is a "mutilated, grief-stricken dusk elf"

<div class="description">
<p>
He is thin in the way of men who have survived history rather than lived through it. His skin is ashen, drawn tight over sharp cheekbones, and his long, dark hair—once carefully kept—now hangs loose and streaked with premature silver, as though grief itself has begun to bleach him. His violet dusk-elf eyes are alert but hollow, fixed not quite on you, not quite on the present, as if he is listening to something buried far below the moment.</p>
<p> His right hand and forearm are a pale bluish-white, with much of the skin puffy and blistered.
</div>

4. Kasimir can share some additional lore if asked: [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#^Info-What-Kasimir-Knows|What Kasimir Knows]]. He can also relate the full story of the dusk elves [[Kasimir's Tale]]
5. Then they shall go to the Burgomaster's Mansion! Ireena's desire to converse with the Baron about the plight of the Barovian refugees might be a good cover. If Ireena occupies the Baron with her conversation, the players can attempt to visit the library by subterfuge. Or, they can appeal to him directly — Ireena wants to talk, the rest want to peruse the library. They're greeted by Claudia, the baron's maid.
