# Shaundakul

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Shaundakul is a god of journeys and travelers. Both mundane and magical means of travel fall under his sphere of influence. Though the heyday of his worship has long since passed, the Rider of the Winds still leaves his mark on Faerûn via rare portal-shrines dotted across the continent.

Shaundakul is an ancient deity, but his worship dwindled in the aftermath of the fall of Myth Drannor, where his chief temple was located. A small but dedicated contingent of scattered priests carries on his faith. Shaundakul communicates with these remaining followers by manifesting as an elderly voice carried on a crisp zephyr.

Travelers pray to Shaundakul before embarking on long treks. Spellcasters invoke his name while casting the [[Teleport|XPHB]] spell in the hope that he will take them safely to their desired destination. Apart from such brief invocations, lay worship of Shaundakul is rare in the Realms.

Shaundakul's priests wear garb appropriate for arduous treks. Each wears a gauntlet or glove on their left hand: silken lace, gauze, or other diaphanous material trails at the wrist. His only remaining temple is Shaundakul's Throne in the ruins of Myth Drannor. The ruins are infamously perilous, so priests seldom congregate there. Instead, they aim to unearth and protect other shrines to Shaundakul left from long-gone eras. These stone shrines bear the chiseled holy symbol of Shaundakul: a humanlike figure walking on the wind. Each shrine of Shaundakul is linked to another somewhere in Faerûn. When a hopeful traveler stands before the shrine and uses the appropriate command word, a two-way portal of swirling air materializes to connect the two locations. Unless these command words are displayed at the shrine, Shaundakul's priests must sift through ancient dungeons to find them or beseech adventurers to do so.

Chosen of Shaundakul take to the skies through spells like [[Fly|XPHB]] and [[Wind Walk|XPHB]]. These Chosen help Shaundakul's lesser priests make the dangerous pilgrimage through Myth Drannor to Shaundakul's Throne. Some take vows to cleanse the ruins of Myth Drannor of the monsters that lurk therein.
