## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The absorber has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Pounce.** If the absorber moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits its claws attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is [[prone]], the absorber can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The absorber makes three attacks: one with its bite or Mind Bolt and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) force damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) force damage.

**Mind Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h22 (**4d10**) psychic damage.



## Reactions

**Tail Ray.** When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
