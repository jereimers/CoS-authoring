# Adventurer's Ring

*Item, Common*

While the cover on this ring is open, the ring produces a flame that creates no heat and consumes no fuel. It sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 20 feet. As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can close the cover, smothering the flame, or open it again.
