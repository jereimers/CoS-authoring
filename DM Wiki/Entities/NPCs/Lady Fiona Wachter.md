# Lady Fiona Wachter Profile

## Portrait
![[05-007.fiona-wachter.png]]

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Lady Wachter should inspire wariness for her loyalty to Strahd, grudging respect for her streak of pragmatic rationality, endearment for her dedication to her children, and pity for the tragedy of her family.

### Emotions
Lady Wachter most often feels concerned, apprehensive, irate, melancholic, satisfied, thoughtful, determined, stern, or (with her children) compassionate and loving.

### Motivations
Lady Wachter wants to keep Vallaki—and especially her children—safe from harm. To that end, she hopes to see [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] removed from power and to reassure [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] that Vallaki is no danger to his rule.

### Inspirations

## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Lady Wachter is a cold, cunning, and cordial noblewoman. To those she trusts, Lady Wachter is a melancholic, wry, yet fiercely determined advocate for what she sees as the good of Vallaki. Only Lady Wachter herself appreciates the depth of love she feels for her children—and her shattered sense of faith and hope.

### Morale
In a fight, Lady Wachter would attempt to negotiate or flee, seeking any means necessary to quell hostilities, up to and including outright surrender. If necessary to save her life or those of her children, however, she would fight to the death with bitter ferocity.

### Relationships
Lady Wachter is the widow of the deceased Nikolai Wachter I, and the mother of Nikolai Wachter II, Karl Wachter, and Stella Wachter. She is the employer of the **spy** Ernst Larnak, and an outspoken critic of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]].

### Knowledge
![[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish#^Lore-What-Lady-Wachter-Knows]]

# Statblock
Lady Wachter still has the statistics of a **priest**. However, she has a different list of prepared spells:

* Cantrips (at will): _light, toll the dead, thaumaturgy_ 
* 1st level (4 slots): _command, sanctuary, bane_ 
* 2nd level (3 slots): _blindness/deafness, zone of truth, hold person_ 
* 3rd level (2 slots): _animate dead, spirit guardians_
