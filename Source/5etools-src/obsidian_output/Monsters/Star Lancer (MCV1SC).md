## Traits

**Flyby.** The star lancer doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.


## Actions

**Horn.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage. If the star lancer moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 10 (**3d6**) piercing damage.

**Invisibility Cloak (3/Day).** The star lancer and one creature riding it (chosen by the star lancer) magically turn [[invisible]]. This effect lasts until the star lancer or a creature riding it attacks or casts a spell, or until the star lancer's [[concentration]] ends (as if [[concentration]] on a spell). Any equipment worn or carried by the [[invisible]] creatures is also [[invisible]] for the duration of the Invisibility Cloak.
