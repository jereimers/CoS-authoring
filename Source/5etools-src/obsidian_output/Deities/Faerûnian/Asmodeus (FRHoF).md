# Asmodeus

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Both a god of indulgence and an archdevil, Asmodeus rules over his devilish kin from the bottommost layer of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus promises his followers pleasures and powers beyond their wildest dreams—for a price.

Asmodeus's reputation for uneven bargains precedes him. Even so, folk of all moral leanings strike deals with the archdevil when they have nowhere else to turn.For instance, when followers of other deities transgress against their patrons, these folk might bargain with Asmodeus to hide their sins from the other gods. Asmodeus is charismatic and seemingly generous when he needs to be, and his messengers are as silver-tongued as he is. When attempting to manipulate a mortal into entering a pact with him, he sends a snake or an unassuming [[Imp|XMM]]. He also enjoys using [[Erinyes|XMM]] as messengers, since unwitting mortals might mistake them for angels. The birth of an animal with nine legs or nine eyes is considered an omen of Asmodeus's influence.

Most cities don't explicitly outlaw the worship of Asmodeus. However, individuals who openly follow him earn the distrust of society, and temples to this archdevil are almost unheard of. Instead, many of Asmodeus's followers keep hidden shrines to the god in their homes.

Priests who serve Asmodeus exploit individuals who succumb to greed and impatience. If a priest of Asmodeus fails to sway a potential worshiper with rewards in this life, the priest tempts them with promises about the afterlife instead. Many individuals fear their souls will languish for centuries in the Fugue Plane after death, awaiting Kelemvor's judgment. Asmodeus's priests promise such individuals that a devil will comfort their waiting soul or whisk them off to the Nine Hells, where they can assume a rank in the infernal host.

Asmodeus's priests obey the commands of his Chosen, feigning humility just as lesser devils do with greater devils. Chosen of Asmodeus can gaze into people's souls, judging their character at a glance. This ability allows the Chosen to discern whether someone's soul has been claimed by a particular deity or whether their fate is still undetermined.
