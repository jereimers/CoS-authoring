%% A faction is a group of people connected by common ethnicity, political cause, or other mission/identity/goal. They can be organized to varying degrees. %%

# Who they are

The Vistani are a nomadic people who travel freely throughout [[Barovia]] and beyond, enjoying privileges that no other inhabitants of the valley possess. Unlike other Barovians, the Vistani can leave and return through the mists at will—a gift granted to them centuries ago by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Count Strahd]] himself.

They are known as storytellers, fortune-tellers, and keepers of ancient traditions. Their culture places great value on hospitality, the sharing of tales, and the reading of fate through the Tarokka—a mystical deck of cards used for divination.

# What the party knows

- **Origins with Strahd:** [[Stanimir's Tale]] revealed that centuries ago, the Vistani saved the life of a wounded prince—nursing him back to health and escorting him safely home through enemy territory. That prince was [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], who in gratitude promised the Vistani free passage and safe haven in his lands forever.

- **The Tser Pool Encampment:** The party spent an evening at the [[Tser Pool Encampment]], a Vistani camp along the Tser River led by [[Stanimir]] ("Papa"). They participated in the Game of Stories, sharing tales around the campfire while eating mutton stew and drinking Barovian wine.

- **Madam Eva:** The ancient Vistani seer [[Madam Eva]] resides at Tser Pool. She performed [[The Tarokka Reading]] for the party, revealing cryptic clues about artifacts and allies that could help them defeat [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].

- **A Second Vistani Camp:** [[Madam Eva]] mentioned that her great-grand-niece [[Arabelle]] lives at a [[Vistani Camp]] southwest of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], along with her father [[Luvash]] and his brother [[Arrigal]]. The party agreed to deliver a toy from [[Blinsky Toys]] to [[Arabelle]] by noon on her name-day.

- **Trusted but Not Entirely:** While the Vistani have shown the party hospitality, [[Madam Eva]] warned of a "shadow" among them—a servant of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] seeking knowledge of the party's future. The party strongly suspects this refers to [[Eliza]], a Vistani woman who seemed overly eager to befriend them.

- **Arturi's Curse:** The Vistani traveler [[Arturi Radanavich]] is cursed to be hunted by undead each night, forcing him to hide in trees until dawn to protect those around him.

# Notes

The Vistani occupy a complex position in Barovia—they enjoy Strahd's protection and can move freely through the mists, which makes some Barovians distrust them as collaborators with the Devil. However, not all Vistani are loyal to Strahd, and some actively work against him.
