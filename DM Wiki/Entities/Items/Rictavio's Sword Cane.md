# Rictavio's Sword Cane

## Description
A **sword cane** carried by [[Rudolph van Richten]] in his guise as the carnival ringmaster "Rictavio." This elegant walking stick conceals a silvered blade within, allowing Van Richten to appear unarmed while remaining prepared for combat.

The blade within is silvered, making it effective against creatures such as werewolves that are resistant to non-silvered weapons—a practical choice for a veteran monster hunter.

## Properties
- **Type:** Simple Melee Weapon (concealed)
- **Damage:** 1d6 + 1 bludgeoning (wooden cane) or piercing (silvered sword)
- **Attack Bonus:** +4 to hit
- **Properties:** Silvered blade
- **Rarity:** Common
- **Attunement:** No

## Combat Statistics
As wielded by Rictavio:
- **Attack:** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target
- **Hit:** 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage (if using the cane) or piercing damage (if using the silvered sword)
- Van Richten can make two attacks with the sword cane as part of his Multiattack action

## Concealment
The sword cane appears to be an ordinary walking stick, befitting a traveling carnival performer. Drawing the blade from the cane is typically done as part of an attack.
