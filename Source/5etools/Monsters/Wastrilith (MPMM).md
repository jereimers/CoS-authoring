## Traits

**Amphibious.** The wastrilith can breathe air and water.

**Corrupt Water.** At the start of each of the wastrilith's turns, exposed water within 30 feet of it is befouled. Underwater, this effect lightly obscures the area until a current clears it away. Water in containers remains corrupted until it evaporates.

A creature that consumes this foul water or swims in it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the foul water for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (**4d6**) poison damage and is [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. At the end of this time, the [[poisoned]] creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 18 (**4d8**) poison damage and is [[poisoned]] until it finishes a long rest.

If another demon drinks the foul water as an action, it gains 11 (`2d10`) temporary hit points.

**Magic Resistance.** The wastrilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The wastrilith makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, and it uses Grasping Spout.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h30 (**4d12 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**4d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Grasping Spout.** The wastrilith magically launches a spout of water at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, and it has disadvantage if it's underwater. On a failed save, it takes 22 (**4d8 + 4**) acid damage and is pulled up to 60 feet toward the wastrilith. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.


## Bonus Actions

**Undertow.** If the wastrilith is underwater, it causes all water within 60 feet of it to be difficult terrain for other creatures until the start of its next turn.
