# Dark Shard Amulet

*Wondrous Item, Common* *(requires attunement by a warlock)*

This amulet is fashioned from a shard of resilient material originating from an otherworldly realm. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

## Spellcasting Focus

You can use the amulet as a [[Spellcasting Focus|XPHB]] for your Warlock spells.

## Unknown Spell

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Warlock spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence ([[Arcana|XPHB]]) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast it is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
