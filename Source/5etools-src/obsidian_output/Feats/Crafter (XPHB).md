# Crafter

You gain the following benefits.

## Tool Proficiency

You gain proficiency with three different [[Artisan's Tools|XPHB]] of your choice from the Fast Crafting table.

## Discount

Whenever you buy a nonmagical item, you receive a 20 percent discount on it.

## Fast Crafting

When you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you can craft one piece of gear from the Fast Crafting table, provided you have the [[Artisan's Tools|XPHB]] associated with that item and have proficiency with those tools. The item lasts until you finish another [[Long Rest|XPHB]], at which point the item falls apart.
