## Actions

**Multiattack.** The warlock makes two Rapier attacks, or it uses Bewildering Word twice.

**Rapier.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) force damage.

**Bewildering Word.** The warlock utters a magical bewilderment, targeting one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or take 9 (**2d8**) psychic damage and have disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of the warlock's next turn.



## Reactions

**Misty Escape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** In response to taking damage, the warlock turns [[invisible]] and teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It remains [[invisible]] until the start of its next turn or until it attacks, makes a damage roll, or casts a spell.
