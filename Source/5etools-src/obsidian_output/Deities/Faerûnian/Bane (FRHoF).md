# Bane

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Bane, a god of tyrants and ambition, has a simple ethos: the strong have the duty to rule over the weak. A tyrant who can seize power must do so; not only does the tyrant benefit, but so do those under the tyrant's rule. When a ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or decrepitude, a stronger and more suitable ruler will rise. Bane is one of the Dead Three, a trio of gods including Bhaal and Myrkul who attained divinity when they absorbed the divine station of a former death god, Jergal, and were then slain during the Time of Troubles. Bane was the first of the three to return and has risen to a more prominent position than he ever held before his death.

Although Bane's worshipers have committed dark deeds in his name, most of them don't do so out of malice. Bane represents ambition and control, and those who have the former but lack the latter pray to him to give them strength. Bane favors those with drive and courage, and he aids those who seek to become conquerors, carve kingdoms from the wilderness, and bring order to the lawless.

Whatever form Bane takes, he is marked by his jet-black right hand. If he wishes to conceal his identity, he wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand. He appears to mortals in dreams as a powerful, shadowy figure in armor wearing a black, jeweled gauntlet. When he sends an emissary, it is usually a [[Horned Devil|XMM]], or it could be a possessed [[Knight|XMM]] with pitch-black eyes who remembers nothing of the encounter later.

At many times and in many places in Faerûn, the faithful of Bane have been heralded as saviors for slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rulers, or saving armies on the brink of defeat. But just as often, the worship of Bane has created or supported cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile monopolies, or subjugated entire populations. Priests of Bane wear a black-enameled gauntlet on one fist. Cults of Bane are particularly active in [[Baldur's Gate|FRHoF]], where noble patriar families are easily enraptured by Bane's promises of power.

The power-hungry Chosen of Bane become warlords or otherwise amass followers to help them seize and consolidate power. Bane's Chosen also act as whispering advisers, tempting and driving rulers to greater acts of cruelty and domination.

## Knights of the Black Gauntlet

The Knights of the Black Gauntlet is a military order of crusaders dedicated to Bane. Based in the city of Mintar on the shores of the [[Lake of Steam|FRHoF]], this organization is ruled with an iron fist by the Lord Knight Imperceptor of Bane. The Black Gauntlet's roster boasts warriors and militant priests who are experienced in commanding troops and who are, in turn, prepared to execute orders without question.

Hopefuls join the order as soldiers (regardless of their class or background) and can expect to be treated as such. The rigid hierarchy of the Black Gauntlet ensures that only those who thrive in and master its unyielding structure can rise in rank. Soldiers follow their commanders on expeditions to secure borders, quell uprisings, and stamp out lawlessness that threatens stability.

Soldiers who show obedience to their superiors, demonstrate leadership, and inspire loyalty or fear might receive knighthood. Candidates for knighthood must demonstrate their leadership on a successful expedition without undermining the Black Gauntlet's hierarchy. Those who are found worthy are promoted and given a contingent of soldiers to oversee. Many don a black gauntlet on one hand. (If your campaign uses renown, your character must also have a Renown Score of 3+ with the Knights of the Black Gauntlet to be knighted.)

Knights of the Black Gauntlet learn tactics and leadership. If your character is a member of the Knights of the Black Gauntlet, you receive a free Comfortable lifestyle at any temple of Bane or outpost of the order. Additionally, if you have a Renown Score of 10+ and are leading an expedition in service to the order can request the temporary service of a [[Helmed Horror|XMM]]. Once you've used this benefit, you can't do so again until your Renown Score increases.

Knights of the Black Gauntlet find allies in the cults of Bhaal and Myrkul, befitting their god's relationship among the Dead Three, as well as the worshipers of Loviatar. Their primary enemies include those who pose threats to the lands they govern, whether rivals from without or destabilizing elements and dissidents within their borders.
