# Instrument of the Bards, Anstruth Harp

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement by a bard)*

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take **2d4** psychic damage.

You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [[charmed]] on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: [[fly]], [[invisibility]], [[levitate]], and [[protection from evil and good]].

In addition, the Anstruth harp can be used to cast [[control weather]], [[cure wounds]] (5th level), and [[wall of thorns]].
