## Traits

**Detect Sentience.** The brain in a jar can sense the presence and location of any creature within 300 feet of it that has an Intelligence of 3 or higher, regardless of interposing barriers, unless the creature is protected by a [[mind blank]] spell.

**Magic Resistance.** The brain in a jar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** The brain in a jar magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 13 (**2d8 + 4**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
