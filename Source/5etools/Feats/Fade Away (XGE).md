# Fade Away

**Prerequisites:** gnome

Your people are clever, with a knack for illusion magic. You have learned a magical trick for fading away when you suffer harm. You gain the following benefits:

- Immediately after you take damage, you can use a reaction to magically become [[invisible]] until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
