## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Viconia has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put Viconia to sleep.

**Living Shadow.** While in dim light or darkness, Viconia has resistance to damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant.

**Special Equipment.** Viconia wears a [[belt of giant strength]] (fire) and a [[cloak of protection]] and wields a [[+3 mace]]. Without the belt, her strength is 12 and her speed is reduced to 20 ft.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Viconia has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Viconia attacks twice with her Magic Mace and uses her Spellcasting action.

**Magic Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**1d6 + 10**) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage.

**Sacred Cleansing {@recharge 4}.** Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 60 feet must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 28 (**8d6**) fire damage plus 28 (**8d6**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
