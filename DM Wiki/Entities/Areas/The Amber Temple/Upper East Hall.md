# X8. Upper East Hall

Glazed amber covers the walls of this twenty-foot-wide, seventy-foot-long arched corridor. The amber doors at both ends of the hall stand open. A closed door is in the middle of the east wall, and three arrow slits are cut into the wall across from it. Cracks in the black marble floor run the length of the hall.

The cracks in the floor were made by the golem in area X10. The arrow slits are 5 inches wide, $21 / 2$ feet tall, and 1 foot thick. They look down on the temple (area X5).
