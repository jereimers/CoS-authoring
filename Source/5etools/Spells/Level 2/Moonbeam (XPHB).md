A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, [[Dim Light|XPHB]] fills the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]], and you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action on later turns to move the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] up to 60 feet.

When the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **2d10** Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the [[Polymorph|XPHB]] spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `2d10` for each spell slot level above 2.
