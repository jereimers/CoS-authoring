# Hex

*1st-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (the petrified eye of a newt)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra **1d6** Necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

If the target drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] before this spell ends, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] on a later turn to curse a new creature.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

Your [[Concentration]] can last longer with a spell slot of level 2 (up to 4 hours), 3-4 (up to 8 hours), or 5+ (24 hours).
