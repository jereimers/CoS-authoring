## Traits

**Halfling Nimbleness.** The adept can move through the space of a medium of larger creature.

**Brave.** The adept has advantage on any saving throws against being [[frightened]].

**Unarmored Defense.** While the adept is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, their AC includes their Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The adept makes three unarmed strikes or three dart attacks.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, the adept can choose one of the following additional effects:

- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop one item it is holding (adept's choice).
- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of the adept's next turn.

**Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the adept deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 3`. If the damage is reduced to 0, the adept catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and the adept has a hand free.
