## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h21 (**2d10 + 10**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) fire damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d6 + 10**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d8 + 10**) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Fire Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (**26d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (**2d6 + 10**) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[prone]]. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
