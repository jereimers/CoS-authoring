## Traits

**Dual Shields.** The giant carries two shields, each of which is accounted for in the giant's AC. The giant must stow or drop one of its shields to hurl rocks.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two fireshield attacks.

**Fireshield.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h22 (**4d6 + 8**) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (**2d6**) fire damage plus 7 (**2d6**) piercing damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +13 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h30 (**4d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.

**Shield Charge.** The giant moves up to 30 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any creature smaller than Huge. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, it makes a fireshield attack against that creature. If the attack hits, the target must also succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed ahead of the giant for the rest of this move. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is also knocked [[prone]] and takes 18 (**3d6 + 8**) bludgeoning damage, or 29 (**6d6 + 8**) bludgeoning damage if it was already [[prone]].
