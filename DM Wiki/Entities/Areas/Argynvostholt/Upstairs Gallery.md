%% --- Page 188 --- %%
This room has dark wood paneling on the walls that rises to a height of three feet. Above the paneling, the walls are painted with murals of religious figures performing holy rites. In the center of the west wall is a tattered curtain hanging in an open doorway. Three tall, slender stained-glass windows set into the opposite wall depict figures in white robes with orange sunrises behind their heads.

From north to south, the three stained-glass windows portray Saint Andral, the Morninglord, and Saint Markovia.
