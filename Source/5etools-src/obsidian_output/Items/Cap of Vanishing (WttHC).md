# Cap of Vanishing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

This cap has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the cap, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action and expend 1 charge to give yourself the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition for 10 minutes. The effect ends early if the hat is removed, or immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.
