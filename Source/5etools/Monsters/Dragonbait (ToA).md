## Traits

**Divine Health.** Dragonbait is immune to disease.

**Magic Resistance.** While holding his [[holy avenger longsword]], Dragonbait creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around him. While this aura is active, Dragonbait and all creatures friendly to him in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Dragonbait makes two melee weapon attacks.

**Holy Avenger (+3 Longsword).** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) slashing damage, or 10 (**1d10 + 5**) slashing damage when used with two hands. If the target is a fiend or an undead it takes an extra 11 (**2d10**) radiant damage.

**Sense Alignment.** Dragonbait chooses one creature he can see within 60 feet of him and determines its alignment, as long as the creature isn't hidden from divination magic by a spell or other magical effect.
