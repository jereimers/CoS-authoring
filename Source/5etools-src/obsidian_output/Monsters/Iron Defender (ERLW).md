## Traits

**Keen Senses.** The defender has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks.

**Telepathic Bond.** While the defender is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take an extra 3 (**1d6**) piercing damage and be [[grappled]] (escape DC 13). The defender can have only one creature [[grappled]] in this way at a time.
