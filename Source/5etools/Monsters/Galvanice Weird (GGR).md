## Traits

**Death Burst.** When the galvanice weird dies, it explodes in a burst of ice and lightning. Each creature within 10 feet of the exploding weird must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (**2d6**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (**2d4**) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or lose the ability to use reactions until the start of the weird's next turn.
