# Clairvoyance

*3rd-level divination*

---

**Casting Time:** 10 minute

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an [[Invisible|XPHB]] sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The intangible, invulnerable sensor remains in place for the duration.

When you cast the spell, choose seeing or hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can switch between seeing and hearing.

A creature that sees the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from [[See Invisibility|XPHB]] or [[Truesight|XPHB]]) sees a luminous orb about the size of your fist.
