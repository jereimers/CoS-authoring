# What the Party knows

## The Problem with Vallaki's Leadership

During dinner at [[Wachterhaus]], [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] explained her concerns about [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]]'s rule:

**About the Baron:**
- The Vallakovich family has ruled [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] for nearly 500 years since Boris Vallakovich founded the town. They claim to have royal blood and consider themselves superior to all others in the valley.
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] came to power 11 years ago when his father, Baron Valentin Vallakovich, passed away in his sleep at barely 50 years old and in perfect health. [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] suspects foul play, though none was ever proven.
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] believes that "happiness" may one day return sunlight to the valley, and has always hosted weekly festivals.
- Since [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s awakening three months ago, [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s beliefs have become an obsessive fixation. He made festival attendance mandatory and criminalized "malicious unhappiness."
- "Lawbreakers" are put in the stocks, but some—like Udo Lukovich, a local shoemaker—have been taken to the mansion for personal "rehabilitation" and haven't been seen since.
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] has barred the [[Refugee Camp|Barovian refugees]] from entering [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], causing significant suffering.
- His will is enforced by [[Izek Strazni]].

**About Izek Strazni:**
- Orphaned at age 10, losing his younger sister and arm in a wolf attack. His sister's body was never found. Both parents died of grief shortly after.
- Was often mocked for his disability, but after several tormentors went missing, the mockery stopped. Rumors say Izek—a large and violent child—murdered them himself, though no bodies were found.
- At age 11, Izek was arrested and brought to the Vallakovich mansion for an unknown crime. He was released soon after, and then-Baronet [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] Vallakovich (then 25 years old) all but adopted him.
- At age 16, Izek somehow obtained a new fiendish arm to replace the one he'd lost—on the same day that Baron Valentin Vallakovich was announced dead. [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] is confident these two events are connected.
- His fiendish arm gave him the power to conjure fire. [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] made him his personal enforcer and a ranking member of the town guard.
- Izek has become a terror throughout [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], committing battery, arson, and extortion both at [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]]'s command and for his own purposes.
- Many townsfolk hate and fear both Izek and [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]], but Izek's strength protects them both.

**About Stella Wachter:**
- Six months ago, [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s daughter [[Stella Wachter|Stella]] began visiting [[Victor Vallakovich]], [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]]'s son, against her mother's advice.
- Just over two months ago, [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] returned [[Stella Wachter|Stella]] to [[Wachterhaus]] in a vegetative state—mindless, speechless, unable to walk, eat, or dress herself.
- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] refused to discuss it in depth, suggesting only that Stella's "fragile constitution" and her family's "exposure to the Devil" were to blame.
- [[Victor Vallakovich|Victor]] has refused to speak to [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] about it at all.
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] is convinced that Izek or the Vallakoviches did something terrible to [[Stella Wachter|Stella]]—and that even if they didn't, their cold refusal to help proves their unfitness to rule.

## The Conspiracy

[[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] explained that many in [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] are uncomfortable with Vallakovich rule and would prefer new leadership. However, as long as [[Izek Strazni]] serves [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]], any attempt to shift political leadership would be met with violent brutality.

Izek is utterly faithful to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]]. His life is the sole obstacle to the change [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] needs.

**The Plan:**
1. Follow Izek and find a time when he is vulnerable—alone, without the guards who usually accompany him. (Any guards will fight to the death to defend him and raise the alarm, complicating the mission.)
2. Kill Izek and dispose of his body, but bring his severed head to [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] as proof. (She says this will greatly aid efforts to encourage [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] to step down peacefully.)
3. Once the task is complete, [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] and her associates will quietly and peacefully oversee the transfer of power.

**Resources Provided:**
- A bottle of **poisoned wine** that will impose the poisoned condition on Izek for 1 hour after he drinks it, dulling his senses and making him more vulnerable.
- Information about Izek's schedule and habits (to be delivered by [[Ernst Larnak]], [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s associate).

**Compensation Offered:**
- Your selection of silvered weapons and ammunition from the town guard's stores.
- Izek's silvered battleaxe and any valuables from his person.
- Additional 100 gp (if negotiated successfully).
- **The [[Barovian refugees]] will be permitted to safely enter [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]** as soon as [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] is removed from power.

## Lady Wachter's Loyalty to Strahd

When asked about her loyalty to [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]], [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] explained her position:

**The Lesson of Berez:**
- [[Barovia (region)|Barovia]], [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], and [[Krezk]] are the valley's three lights of civilization. There was once a fourth: **Berez**, a fishing village on the banks of the Luna River.
- More than 300 years ago, Berez's burgomaster defied [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]]. The details are lost to time, but the histories make clear Berez thought itself able to challenge Strahd's rule.
- Strahd did not argue or negotiate. He simply commanded the river Luna to rise, and it obeyed. The waters swallowed Berez whole. No building was left standing, and few lives were spared.
- What did defiance earn Berez? A marsh and broken stone. A stark warning to anyone who would follow their path.

**Her Philosophy:**
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] is a realist. They live under Strahd's rule, and must learn to come to terms with it. Unlike [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]], Strahd is at least capable of reason.
- As a child, she once heard tales of a sword that shone with the fury of the sun—a weapon that would dawn a new age for [[Barovia (region)|Barovia]]. But "a lady cannot waste time on fairy tales or fools' errands. She must take the world as it is, not the way she wishes it to be."
- Survival requires pragmatism. A lord at peace can be reasoned with—even ignored, with sufficient assurances paid. But a vengeful lord cannot be put aside so easily.
- Defiance leads to destruction. It is their duty—to both ancestors and children—to take that lesson to heart.

**House Wachter's History with Strahd:**
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] follows Ezra, goddess of the Mists, who teaches her followers to look past their hopes (which cloud the mind like fog) and see the world as it truly is. Ezra teaches endurance: "the oak fights the wind and is broken, but the willow bends when it must and survives."
- Centuries ago, [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s ancestor, Lady Lovina Wachter, served Strahd faithfully as his vassal.
- When a traitor and assassin named **Leo Dilisnya** murdered Lovina's husband and attempted to kill Lovina as well, Strahd defended her and hunted Dilisnya down to punish him for his treachery.
- House Wachter has remained loyal to Strahd ever since.

**Her Request:**
- [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] does not begrudge others their hope that the valley may escape Strahd's control. She doesn't seek to destroy that hope or bring unnecessary pain.
- She simply asks that the party bring no harm to [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] as they pursue their goals.
- She admits she may be more willing to believe arguments against Strahd's invincibility should the fabled *Sunsword* itself be found.

## The Traitor

If asked about the "ancient foe of an old and noble house" from [[Madam Eva]]'s Tarokka reading regarding the *Tome of Strahd*, [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] hesitated and promised to tell the party all she knows about her family's history **if they successfully defeat Izek**.

# Leads & Progress
## Initial Leads

- [[Ernst Larnak]], [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s associate, will deliver information about Izek's schedule and the poisoned wine the morning after the dinner.
- Izek is known to be a heavy drinker, making the poisoned wine an effective tool.
- The party should look for opportunities when Izek is alone, away from the guards who usually accompany him.

## Progress Updates

*To be filled in as the quest progresses.*

# Appearance in Sessions

- **[[Session 14 - Neyavr 4, Evening]]** - The party dined at [[Wachterhaus]] where [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] revealed the conspiracy and asked them to assassinate [[Izek Strazni]].
