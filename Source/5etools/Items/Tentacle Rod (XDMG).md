# Tentacle Rod

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This rod ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to direct the tentacles to stretch outward, each one attacking a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. For each tentacle, make a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. A tentacle deals **1d6** Psychic damage on a hit. If you hit the same target with all three tentacles, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until you have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition, until you take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to release the target, or until the target is no longer within 15 feet of you. While [[Restrained|XPHB]] in this way, the target takes **3d6** Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
