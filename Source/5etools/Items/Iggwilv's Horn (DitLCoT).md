# Iggwilv's Horn

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You can use an action to blow this horn to cast one of the following spells from it: [[Arms of Hadar]], [[Fog Cloud]], [[Gust of Wind]], or [[Web]]. If the spell requires a saving throw, the spell save DC is 13.

Once the horn has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
