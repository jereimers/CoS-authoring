## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon turtle can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d12 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Steam Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon turtle exhales steam in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (**5d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
