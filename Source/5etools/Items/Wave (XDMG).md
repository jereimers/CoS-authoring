# Wave

*Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement)*

Held in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, Wave is engraved with images of waves, shells, and sea creatures.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you roll a 20 on the `d20` for an attack roll with this weapon, the target takes an extra 21 Necrotic damage.

While holding Wave, you gain the following benefits:

- **Combat Ready:** You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on [[Initiative|XPHB]] rolls.
- **Underwater Adaptation:** A bubble of air forms around your head while you are underwater, allowing you to breathe normally in that environment.

## Aquatic Command

Wave has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While you carry it, you can expend 1 charge to cast [[Dominate Beast|XPHB]] (save DC 20) from it on a Beast that has a [[Swim Speed|XPHB]].

## Globe of Invulnerability

While holding Wave, you can cast the level 9 version of [[Globe of Invulnerability|XPHB]] from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Sentience

Wave is a sentient weapon of Neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and [[Darkvision|XPHB]] out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Aquan.

## Personality

Wave zealously encourages mortals to worship sea gods and has a habit of humming sea chanteys. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world.

## Destroying Wave

Wave can be destroyed only on the island of Thunderforge, where it was forged. The weapon must be melted down by a [[storm giant|XMM]] or someone imbued with a storm giant's strength. Destroying Wave angers a god of the sea, who sends powerful agents to attack the island and punish the destroyers.
