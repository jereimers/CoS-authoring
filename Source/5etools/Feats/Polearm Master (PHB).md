# Polearm Master

You can keep your enemies at bay with reach weapons. You gain the following benefits:

- When you take the [[Attack]] action and attack with only a [[glaive|phb]], [[halberd|phb]], [[quarterstaff|phb]], or [[spear|phb]], you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon; this attack uses the same ability modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this attack is a `d4`, and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.
- While you are wielding a [[glaive|phb]], [[halberd|phb]], [[pike|phb]], [[quarterstaff|phb]], or [[spear|phb]], other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter the reach you have with that weapon.
