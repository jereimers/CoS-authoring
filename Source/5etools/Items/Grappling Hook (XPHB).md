# Grappling Hook

*Item, None*

As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can throw the Grappling Hook at a railing, a ledge, or another catch within 50 feet of yourself, and the hook catches on if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) check. If you tied a Rope to the hook, you can then climb it.
