## Traits

**Draconic Devotion.** While the officer can see a Dragon that isn't hostile to it, the officer has advantage on attack rolls.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The officer makes two Vicious Lance attacks and uses Assault Orders if it's available.

**Vicious Lance.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) piercing damage plus 2 (**1d4**) fire damage.

**Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) fire damage.

**Assault Orders {@recharge 5}.** The officer shouts orders and targets up to two other creatures within 60 feet of itself. If a target has the Draconic Devotion trait and can hear the officer, the target can use its reaction to make one melee attack.
