# Objective
Find [[Gertruda]], who disappeared from the [[Village of Barovia]] and was last believed to be traveling alone toward [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].

# What the Party knows
- [[Gertruda]] is the twenty-one-year-old daughter of [[Mary]], a woman in the village of Barovia. She is also the betrothed of [[Doru]], who was transformed into a vampire spawn after his failed rebellion.
- Ever since Doru's disappearance, Gertruda became fixated on traveling to Vallaki, believing she could convince the Burgomaster there to send aid to the village.
- [[Mary]] and Gertruda had a heated argument the night before her disappearance. The next morning, Mary found their old horse Nori missing from her stall—and Gertruda nowhere to be found.
- [[Doru]], upon learning of Gertruda's disappearance, was visibly distraught. He asked the party to look out for her and help bring her home should they find her.
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] promised to organize a search party of local hunters and trappers to look for Gertruda along the roads.
- The guards at Vallaki's gates told the party they hadn't seen anyone matching Gertruda's description.

# Leads
- Gertruda was traveling alone toward [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] on horseback.
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s search party may have found information about her fate.
- The road between Barovia and Vallaki passes through dangerous territory, including the River Ivlis Crossroads and the Svalich Woods.

# Secrets
- Gertruda never made it to Vallaki. While traveling through the Svalich Woods, she was intercepted by [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s black carriage. Strahd, amused by her courage, invited her to [[Castle Ravenloft]] to "discuss reparations."
- Gertruda is currently an "honored guest" at Castle Ravenloft, held in comfortable but inescapable chambers. Strahd has no intention of releasing her.
- Gertruda's fate is tied to [[Arc P - Ravenloft Heist]] and any future exploration of Castle Ravenloft.
