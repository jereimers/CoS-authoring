# Eldath

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Eldath is a god of comfort, healing, stillness, and peaceful waters. She is thought to be present at waterfalls, springs, pools, and glades, particularly those visited by druids. Her blessed waters heal the sick, ease troubled minds, and comfort the dying. When she speaks to her followers, Eldath appears as a serene humanlike face formed from flowing water in a pool or waterfall, or she sends a [[Centaur Warden|XMM]] or a [[Merfolk Wavebender|XMM]] to deliver her instructions.

Most rural settlements have a pond or a glade that locals ascribe to Eldath. Tradition dictates that the site remain a place of quiet reflection. The body of water serves as a repository of offerings. Within a glade, people tie offerings to a bush or tree. Offerings are broken weapons or items associated with arguments, which the faithful discard while praying for peace. Many who favor Eldath are pacifists or people troubled by violence they have witnessed or experienced.

Eldath's priests don't organize into large sects. Instead they wander between holy sites and shrines, ensuring locations are cared for and that they remain places of sweet serenity. The faithful of Eldath are close to nature and allied to druids. It is taboo to strike a priest of Eldath, and killing one is said to bring great misfortune. Despite this protection, some priests of Eldath avoid conflict entirely, while others quickly step in to soothe strife and disharmony. Those who serve Eldath preside over peaceful negotiations and certify treaties. Eldath is served by the Yielding Way, an order of monks devoted to peace and protection, and by the Tall Trees, a circle of druids operating in the High Forest.

Eldath's Chosen are known as Lotuses and wear a lotus blossom blessed never to wilt as long as they have Eldath's favor. Lotuses serve as ambassadors and mediators whose mere presence can extinguish violence and rage.
