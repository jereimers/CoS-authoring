# Druidic

**Type:** Secret  
**Script:** None  
**Typical Speakers:** {@class druid||druids}/{@creature druid||druids}, {@creature treant||treants}

Druidic is the secret language of druids. It can be spoken or used to leave hidden messages. Creatures who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check but can't decipher it without magic.
