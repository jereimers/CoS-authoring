# Instrument of Illusions

*Wondrous Item, Common*

While you are playing this [[musical instrument|XPHB]], you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 5-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the instrument. If you are a Bard, the size of the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing.
