# Bomb

*Item, None*

As an action, you can light a Bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on that point makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d6** Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
