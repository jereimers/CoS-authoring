# Primal Amulet

*Item, Unknown (Magic)*

This beaded jade necklace bears an ancient symbol of the River Heralds. When worn, the primal amulet allows its wearer to cast [[speak with animals]], [[locate object]], and [[pass without trace]]. Once the amulet has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
