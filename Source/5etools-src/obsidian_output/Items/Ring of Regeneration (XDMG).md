# Ring of Regeneration

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you regain `1d6` [[Hit Points|XPHB]] every 10 minutes if you have at least 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `1d6 + 1` days if you have at least 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] the whole time.
