## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a tangle of vines.


## Actions

**Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, and a Large or smaller target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the blight can't constrict another target.

**Entangling Plants {@recharge 5}.** Grasping roots and vines sprout in a 15-foot radius centered on the blight, withering away after 1 minute. For the duration, that area is difficult terrain for nonplant creatures. In addition, each creature of the blight's choice in that area when the plants appear must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or become [[restrained]]. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check, freeing itself or another entangled creature within reach on a success.
