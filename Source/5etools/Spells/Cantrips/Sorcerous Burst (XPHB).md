# Sorcerous Burst

*Cantrip evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes **1d8** damage of a type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder.

If you roll an 8 on a `d8` for this spell, you can roll another `d8`, and add it to the damage. When you cast this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you can add to the spell's damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier.

## Cantrip Upgrade

The damage increases by **1d8** when you reach levels 5 (**2d8**), 11 (**3d8**), and 17 (**4d8**).
