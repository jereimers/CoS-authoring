## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** A howler has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the howler's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The howler makes two bite attacks.

**Rending Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage. If the target is [[frightened]] it takes an additional 22 (**4d10**) psychic damage. This attack ignores damage resistance.

**Mind-Breaking Howl {@recharge}.** The howler emits a keening howl in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area that isn't [[deafened]] must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] until the end of the howler's next turn. While a creature is [[frightened]] in this way, its speed is halved, and it is [[incapacitated]]. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.
