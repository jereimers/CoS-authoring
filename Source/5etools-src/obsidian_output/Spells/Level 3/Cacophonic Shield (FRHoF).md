Thunderous reverberations fill a 10-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you for the duration. Whenever the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes **3d6** Thunder damage and has the [[Deafened|XPHB]] condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn. When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it.

In addition, you have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Thunder damage, and ranged attack rolls against you are made with [[Disadvantage|XPHB]].

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 3.
