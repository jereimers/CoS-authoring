# Blood of the Lycanthrope

*Item, None*

This poison is created from blood harvested from a dead or [[incapacitated]] lycanthrope in its animal or hybrid form. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy (see the Monster Manual). The curse lasts until removed by the [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.

The type of lycanthropy depends on the lycanthrope used to create the poison. To determine the type of lycanthropy randomly, roll a `d6`:

| d6 | Lycanthropy |
|---|---|
| 1-3 | [[Wererat]] |
| 4-5 | [[Werewolf]] |
| 6 | [[Wereboar]] |
