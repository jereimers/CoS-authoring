# Overview
More than a dozen ramshackle tents have been set up against the [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] palisade wall. Among them, dozens of ragged, emaciated people mill about or sit by low-burning campfires and bedrolls, their hollow gazes watching silently.


# What the party knows
- The Barovian refugees arrived at Vallaki's gates a few weeks ago, but were barred from entering. When they attempted to breach the gates by force, the guards summoned a man they called [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], who bore a twisted devil's arm and conjured fire to drive the refugees back.
* Since then, the refugees have set up camp outside the town's walls, clustering together for protection and warmth. They've managed to secure some minor necessities, such as the tents, by bribing the guards at the gates, but have been unable to persuade the guards to allow them entry or to even invite the town's Baron to discuss their plight.
* Swarms of bats and packs of wolves have plagued the camp each night since they've arrived. Thankfully, no one has died yet, but several refugees have been wounded.
* Due to losses they suffered on the road and the threat of the Devil in Castle Ravenloft, the refugees are unwilling to risk the journey back home, instead hoping to wait until [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] sees reason and allows them to enter the walls.
* Roughly one-quarter of the refugees have become addicted to "dream pastries," a foodstuff sold by the peddler [[Morgantha]]. These refugees seek an escape from the misery and despair of their situation.

# Notable figures
- [[Emeric]] and [[Magda]] -- the two de facto leaders of the refugee group.
- [[Franz]] -- the poor, dream-pastry-addicted sap with only half his teeth (thanks, [[Arden Nalero|Arden]]).
- [[Morgantha]] -- the kindly old lady who peddles [[Dream Pastry|Dream Pastries]].
- [[Parriwimple]] is staying with the refugees for now, to provide defense against wolves and help with campground tasks.
