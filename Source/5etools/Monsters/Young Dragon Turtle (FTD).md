## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon turtle can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon turtle makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d12 + 5**) piercing damage plus 6 (**1d12**) lightning damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Steam Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon turtle exhales steam in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (**12d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
