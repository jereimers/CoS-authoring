# Basic Fishing Equipment

*Item, None*

Basic Fishing Equipment includes a pole, a line, a hook, and either a lure or some bait.

Fishing is a popular pastime in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, though this activity isn't possible aboard a ship that is moving faster than its flying speed. At the end of each hour spent fishing, a character can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during that hour. On a successful check, roll a `d10` and consult the Fishing table to determine the catch.

| d10 | Catch |
|---|---|
| 1–2 | Tiny, inedible fish (a creature that consumes it is poisoned for 1 hour) |
| 3–5 | Tiny, edible fish (feeds one person) |
| 6–8 | Small, edible fish (feeds up to four people) |
| 9 | Hostile [[space eel|BAM]] (see [[Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM]]; feeds up to twelve people) |
| 10 | Hostile [[gray scavver|BAM]] (see [[Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM]]; feeds up to twenty people), some other creature of the DM's choosing, or an Tiny object of the DM's choosing |
