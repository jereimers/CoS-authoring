## Traits

**Apotheonic Rejuvenation.** When Alyxian the Callous drops to 0 hit points, his body dies and sheds its wings, and he rises to his feet in his third form, Alyxian the Dispossessed. His initiative count doesn't change.

**Divinely Blessed.** Alyxian can't be [[surprised]] and can't be changed into another form against his will.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Alyxian makes two Radiant Spear attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with Blinding Teleport.

**Radiant Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) radiant damage.

**Blinding Teleport.** Alyxian teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space he can see within 120 feet of himself. Each creature within 5 feet of his new location must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn.

**Heavenly Destruction (1/Day).** Alyxian releases divine energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature of his choice in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 31 (**7d8**) radiant damage and is knocked [[prone]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** Alyxian makes one Radiant Spear attack.

**Celestial Chains.** Alyxian targets one creature he can see within 120 feet of himself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be [[restrained]] by magical chains for 1 minute. While [[restrained]] in this way, the target can't leave the space by any means. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Flare (Costs 2 Actions).** Alyxian targets one creature he can see within 30 feet of himself. Light flares around the target, dealing 17 (**5d6**) radiant damage to it and creatures within 10 feet of it.
