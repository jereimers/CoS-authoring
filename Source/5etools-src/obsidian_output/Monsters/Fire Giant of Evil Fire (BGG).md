## Traits

**Shrapnel Explosion.** When the giant drops to 0 hit points, its armor explodes, destroying the giant's body and scattering the armor as shrapnel. Creatures within 10 feet of the giant when its armor explodes must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (**6d6**) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two Searing Scepter attacks or two Bolt of Imix attacks.

**Searing Scepter.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d6 + 7**) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (**2d8**) fire damage, and the target is magically branded. While branded in this way, the target becomes visible if it's [[invisible]], can't become [[invisible]], and sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. The brand disappears after 24 hours, or it can be removed from a creature or an object by any spell that ends a curse.

**Bolt of Imix.** Ranged Spell Attack +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d10 + 4**) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[frightened]] condition until the end of the target's next turn.
