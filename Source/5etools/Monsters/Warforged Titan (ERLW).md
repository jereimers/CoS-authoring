## Traits

**Platforms.** The warforged titan has two platforms built into its chassis. One Medium or smaller creature can ride on each platform without squeezing. To make a melee attack against a target within 5 feet of the warforged, they must use spears or weapons with reach and the target must be Large or larger.

**Siege Monster.** The warforged titan deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The warforged titan makes one axehand attack and one hammerfist attack.

**Axehand.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) slashing damage, plus 11 (**2d10**) slashing damage if the target is [[prone]].

**Hammerfist.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Sweeping Axe {@recharge}.** The warforged titan makes a sweep with its axehand, and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 19 (**3d8 + 6**) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
