# Manifest Charm of Mabar, the Endless Night

*Charm*

When you use a spell slot to cast a spell that animates or summons an Undead (including [[Animate Dead|XPHB]], [[Create Undead|XPHB]], or [[Summon Undead|XPHB]]), you can expend the Charm (no action required) to treat the spell as if it were cast using a spell slot 1 level above the slot expended.
