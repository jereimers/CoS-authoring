# Gloves of Missile Snaring

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

If you're hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to reduce the damage by `1d10` plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
