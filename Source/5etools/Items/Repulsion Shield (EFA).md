# Repulsion Shield

*Item, Uncommon*

You gain a +1 bonus to [[Armor Class|XPHB]] while wielding this shield.

The shield has 4 charges. While holding it, when a Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to expend 1 of the shield's charges and push the attacker up to 15 feet straight away. The shield regains `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn.
