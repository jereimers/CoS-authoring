# Ghoulish Encounter 
The ghostly chanting heard throughout the dungeon is noticeably louder to the north. When one or more characters reach the midpoint of the four-way tunnel intersection, four ghouls (former cultists) rise up out of the ground in the spaces marked $X$ on the map and attack. The ghouls fight until destroyed.
