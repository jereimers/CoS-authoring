## Traits

**Salt Osmosis.** Whenever the snail starts its turn in contact with a pound or more of salt, it takes **1d4** necrotic damage. Using an action to sprinkle a pound of salt on the snail deals **1d4** necrotic damage to it immediately and another **1d4** necrotic damage to it at the start of its next turn (after which the salt rubs off), provided the snail has not withdrawn into its shell.


## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Shell Defense.** The snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a +4 bonus to its AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as a bonus action on its turn.
