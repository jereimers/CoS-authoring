# Shatter

*2nd-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (A burst of mica.)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A non-magical item that is not worn or carried also suffers damage if it is in the area of the spell.
**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 3 or higher level spell slot, the damage of the spell increases by 1d8 for each level of higher spell slot 2.

**Classes:** [[Bard]], [[Sorcerer]], [[Warlock]], [[Wizard]]
