# Pact of the Chain

You learn the [[Find Familiar|XPHB]] spell and can cast it as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [[Imp|XMM]], [[Pseudodragon|XMM]], [[Quasit|XMM]], [[Skeleton|XMM]], [[Slaad Tadpole|XMM]], [[Sphinx of Wonder|XMM]], [[Sprite|XMM]], or [[Venomous Snake|XMM]] (see appendix B for the familiar's stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its [[Reaction|XPHB]].
