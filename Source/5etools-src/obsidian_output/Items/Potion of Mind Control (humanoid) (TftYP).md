# Potion of Mind Control (humanoid)

*Item, Rare*

When you drink a potion of mind control, you can cast a dominate spell (save DC 15) on a specific creature if you do so before the end of your next turn. If you don't, the potion is wasted.

A potion of mind control produces the effect of a [[dominate person]] spell. If the target's initial saving throw fails, the effect lasts for 1 hour, with no [[concentration]] required on your part. The [[charmed]] creature has disadvantage on new saving throws to break the effect during this time.
