## Traits

**Dying Burst.** When the clown drops to 0 hit points, it pops like a balloon, releasing a splash of putrid, corrosive ichor. Each creature within 5 feet of the clown when it bursts must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Squeakers.** The clown wears shoes that squeak when it walks. The squeaking can be heard out to a range of 30 feet. The squeaking is silenced while the clown's Phantasmal Form is in effect.


## Actions

**Shock.** Melee Spell Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**4d6 + 3**) lightning damage.

**Ray Gun.** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h7 (**2d6**) psychic damage, and if the target is a Humanoid with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher, it must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target perceives everything it sees or hears as hilariously funny and is [[incapacitated]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Bonus Actions

**Phantasmal Form (3/Day).** The clown veils itself and everything it is wearing and carrying in an illusion that makes it look like some other creature of its size or smaller (such as a child) or an object small enough to fit in the clown's space (such as a floating balloon). Maintaining this effect requires the clown's [[concentration]] (as if [[concentration]] on a spell), and the illusion fails to hold up to physical inspection. As an action, a creature that can see the clown's illusory form can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check, piercing the illusion and discerning the clown's true form on a success.
