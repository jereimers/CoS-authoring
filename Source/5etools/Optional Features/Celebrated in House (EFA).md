# Celebrated in House

When you request a favor from your house (as decribed under "[[Favored in House|EFA]]"), it can take one of the following additional forms:

- A dragonmarked member of the house casts for you a level 3 or 4 spell associated with the house's mark at no cost.
- A member of the house casts for you a different spell of level 6 or lower at half the usual cost.
- You gain a bodyguard for the duration of your next mission for the house (maximum of 1 week). The bodyguard—a creature with a [[Challenge Rating|XPHB]] no higher than half your level (round up)—is appropriate to your house.

In addition, your house stipend increases to support your Wealthy lifestyle (4 GP per day).
