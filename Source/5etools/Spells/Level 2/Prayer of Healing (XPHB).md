# Prayer of Healing

*2nd-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 10 minute  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

Up to five creatures of your choice who remain within range for the spell's entire casting gain the benefits of a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] and also regain `2d8` [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. A creature can't be affected by this spell again until that creature finishes a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The healing increases by `2d8` for each spell slot level above 2.
