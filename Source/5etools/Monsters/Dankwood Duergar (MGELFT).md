## Traits

**Duergar Resilience.** The Dankwood duergar has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being [[charmed]] or [[paralyzed]].

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the Dankwood duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Verbal Jab.** The duergar unleashes a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature they can see within 60 feet. If the creature can hear them (it doesn't need to understand them), it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or take **1d4** psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

**Haymaker.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the duergar is enlarged, increase their damage to 10 (**2d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage.
