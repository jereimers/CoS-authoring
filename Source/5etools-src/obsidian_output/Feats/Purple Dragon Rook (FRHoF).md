# Purple Dragon Rook

You gain the following benefits.

## Entreat

You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: [[Insight|XPHB]], [[Performance|XPHB]], or [[Persuasion|XPHB]].

## Rallying Cry

When you roll [[Initiative|XPHB]] and don't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition, you can choose a number of creatures equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]] that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Those creatures gain [[Heroic Inspiration|XPHB]].

Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
