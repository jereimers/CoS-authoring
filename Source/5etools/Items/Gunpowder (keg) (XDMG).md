# Gunpowder (keg)

*Item, None*

Setting fire to a keg full of Gunpowder causes it to explode. When a keg explodes, each creature in a 10-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on the keg makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 (**7d6**) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
