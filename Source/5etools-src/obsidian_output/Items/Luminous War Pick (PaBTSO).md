# Luminous War Pick

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

The haft of this war pick is inlaid with crushed pearlescent stones that imbue the weapon with a faint luminescence. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this war pick.

While wielding the war pick, you can use a bonus action to cast the [[daylight]] spell, choosing a point on the war pick. Once you use this bonus action, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
