# Hunter's Mark

*1st-level divination*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

---

You magically mark one creature you can see within range as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra **1d6** Force damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. You also have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on any Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]] or [[Survival|XPHB]]) check you make to find it.

If the target drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] before this spell ends, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to move the mark to a new creature you can see within range.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

Your [[Concentration]] can last longer with a spell slot of level 3-4 (up to 8 hours) or 5+ (up to 24 hours).
