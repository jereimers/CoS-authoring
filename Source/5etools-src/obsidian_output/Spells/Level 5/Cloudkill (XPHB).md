# Cloudkill

*5th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

You create a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by [[Gust of Wind|XPHB]]) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]].

Each creature in the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **5d8** Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] moves into its space and when it enters the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `5d8` for each spell slot level above 5.
