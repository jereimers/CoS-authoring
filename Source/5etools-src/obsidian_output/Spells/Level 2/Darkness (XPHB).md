# Darkness

*2nd-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

For the duration, magical [[Darkness|XPHB]] spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. [[Darkvision|XPHB]] can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the [[Darkness|XPHB]] to fill a 15-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the [[Darkness|XPHB]].

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [[Bright Light|XPHB]] or [[Dim Light|XPHB]] created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
