## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day).** If the dragonborn fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Mental Defense.** While the dragonborn is wearing no armor, its AC includes its Intelligence modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragonborn makes three Mind Blade attacks.

**Mind Blade.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.

**Heat Breath {@recharge}.** The dragonborn exhales a wave of intense heat in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (**6d8**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Metal objects in that area glow red-hot until the end of the dragonborn's next turn. Any creature in physical contact with a heated object at the start of its turn must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (**2d8**) fire damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn.
