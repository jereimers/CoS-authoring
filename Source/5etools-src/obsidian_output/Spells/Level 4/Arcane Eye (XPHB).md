You create an [[Invisible|XPHB]], invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has [[Darkvision|XPHB]] with a range of 30 feet.

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.
