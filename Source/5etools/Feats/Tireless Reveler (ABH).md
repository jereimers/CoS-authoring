# Tireless Reveler

When an ally you can see within 60 feet of yourself expends [[Heroic Inspiration|XPHB]], you can gain [[Heroic Inspiration|XPHB]] if you lack it. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
