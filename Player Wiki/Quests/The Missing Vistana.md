# Objective

Find [[Arabelle]], the seven-year-old daughter of [[Luvash]], who was kidnapped three days ago from the [[Vistani Camp]].

# What the Party Knows

## The Abduction

Three days ago ([[Neyavr 1]]), [[Arabelle]] vanished while under the watch of her cousin [[Alexei]]. The circumstances were suspicious:

- [[Yan]], a long-time member of the Vistani encampment, gave Alexei wine that caused him to fall into a deep, drunken sleep
- When Alexei awoke, both Arabelle and Yan were gone
- [[Savid]] (a dusk elf guard) discovered Yan's decapitated body near the [[Luna River]], with clear signs of a violent struggle

## Evidence from the Crime Scene

The party investigated the riverside clearing where Yan's body was found and discovered:

**Three Sets of Footprints:**
1. First set came from the north, ended abruptly in grass (this was Yan's - he died here)
2. Second set came from the north, continued southwest to a tree trunk 30 feet away, then went UP into the canopy (someone fled by climbing)
3. Third set emerged from the western woods, showed signs of fighting with the first, then led toward the riverbank carrying something heavy and child-sized

**Physical Evidence:**
- A torn shred of expensive **silk fabric** caught on a tree branch 20 feet up (where the second set of footprints fled)
- The silk fabric carried a faint **whiff of undead energy** (detected by [[Arden Nalero|Arden]]'s divine senses)
- A **platinum signet ring** bearing [[Khazan]]'s personal sigil (symbols of necromancy and evocation schools of magic), dropped during the struggle

**The Party's Conclusion:**
The evidence points to [[Escher]], [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s vampire spawn coachman whom they met at the [[River Ivlis Crossroads]] in [[Session 05 - Out of Barovia|Session 5]]. The expensive silk, undead energy, and ability to climb/flee into trees all match. Arabelle was likely taken to [[Castle Ravenloft]].

## The Mysterious Ring

[[Kasimir Velikov]] identified the ring's symbols as representing necromancy and evocation magic, and noted the sigil belonged to [[Khazan]], an archmage who built a tower on [[Lake Baratok]]. [[Victor Vallakovich]] confirmed this, explaining that Khazan's tower is heavily enchanted and sits at the end of a gravel causeway on the lake.

The ring's presence at the abduction site suggests a connection between Arabelle's kidnapping and Khazan's tower, though the exact nature of this connection remains unclear.

# Leads & Progress

## Active Leads

- **Castle Ravenloft:** The party believes Arabelle was taken to Strahd's castle by Escher. They need to find a way to infiltrate the castle and rescue her.

- **Khazan's Tower:** The mysterious ring suggests investigating the wizard's tower on [[Lake Baratok]] might provide clues about why Arabelle was taken. [[Victor Vallakovich]] has asked the party to explore the tower and bring back any magical artifacts they find. [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] can guide them there.

- **The Second Witness:** Someone else was at the abduction site (the one who climbed the tree and fled). Identifying this person might provide crucial information about what happened. *(DM Note: This was likely [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]], who left behind the monogrammed handkerchief with initials "R.V.R.")*

## Reward

[[Luvash]] has promised 500 gold pieces—or treasure of equal worth—if the party brings Arabelle home safely.

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Visiting the Vistani|Session 13]] — Received the quest from [[Luvash]] and [[Arrigal]] at the [[Vistani Camp]]; investigated the crime scene at the [[Luna River]]; discovered evidence pointing to [[Escher]] and [[Castle Ravenloft]]
