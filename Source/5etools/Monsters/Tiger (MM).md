## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The tiger has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Pounce.** If the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is [[prone]], the tiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) slashing damage.
