## Traits

**Earth Glide.** The dao can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesn't disturb the material it moves through.

**Elemental Demise.** If the dao dies, its body disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the dao was wearing or carrying.

**Sure-Footed.** The dao has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [[prone]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Dao makes two fist attacks or two maul attacks.

**Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Maul.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h20 (**4d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked [[prone]].
