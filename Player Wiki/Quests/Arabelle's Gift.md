# Objective
Purchase a gift for [[Arabelle]] at [[Blinsky Toys]] in [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], then deliver the toy to her at the [[Vistani Camp]] outside town before noon on her nameday ([[Neyavr 4]])

# What the Party knows
- In exchange for performing a Tarokka Reading for the party, [[Madam Eva]] handed [[Arden Nalero|Arden]] a pouch coins worth 10gp and asked them to buy and deliver a gift for her great grand-niece, [[Arabelle]]. 
- Eva directed the party to [[Blinsky Toys]] in [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], saying that the toymaker's products were Arabelle's favorite.
- Arabelle lives with her family in the [[Vistani Camp]] southwest of town. [[Madam Eva]] hinted that the party might especially appreciate meeting her father, [[Luvash]] (the leader of the camp), and her uncle, [[Arrigal]] (a "perceptive and intelligent man"). 

# Leads
- [[Blinsky Toys]] can be found south of the Vallaki center ([[map-05.01-vallaki.jpg|N7 on this map]])
- The [[Vistani Camp]] is southwest of town ([[map-05.01-vallaki.jpg|N9 on this map]])

# Outcome

**Quest Complete**

The party successfully purchased a wind-up carousel toy from [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] and delivered it to the [[Vistani Camp]] on [[Neyavr 4]], Arabelle's nameday. However, upon arrival, they discovered that [[Arabelle]] had been kidnapped three days prior. [[Luvash]], Arabelle's father, was grateful for the attempt but immediately enlisted the party's aid in finding his missing daughter, leading directly to the quest [[The Missing Vistana]].
