# Mark of Finding

You gain the following benefits.

## Hunter's Intuition

When you make a Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]] or [[Survival|XPHB]]) check, you can roll `1d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

## Finder's Magic

You always have the [[Hunter's Mark|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat).

When you reach character level 3, you also always have the [[Locate Object|XPHB]] spell prepared and can cast it the same way.

## Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Finding Spells table are added to that feature's spell list.
