# Intro
%% 
This is not canon, but its starting point requires only minor tweaks to the existing story thus far. 
## RetCons
- Madam Eva's gift was requested not for Arabelle's nameday, but instead for the Long Night.
- Eva shared lore about Long Night.
- The date of their arrival in Vallaki. Instead of arriving on Neyavr 2, they have arrived on Dekavr 19 -- just three days before the Long Night. 
- Their encounters with NPCs from Session 9 will remain almost exactly the same, with one key change: the Baron's next festival is to be the "Festival of Enduring Light", not the "Festival of the Blazing Sun".

## What you saw in Vallaki

- Forced carolers singing the same song: "All will be well"
- A bonfire (unlit), partially set up and under guard in the town square.
- 

It's mid-Dekavr in Vallaki, and the town is soft with pillowy snow. You awake in one big bed to find that Choppy is missing; you hear groans from the en suite bathroom and find a note stuck to the door. 
It reads, "accidentally cast Ray of Sickness on self" in hurriedly scrawled ink. 

Downstairs, Urwin fixes breakfast.
