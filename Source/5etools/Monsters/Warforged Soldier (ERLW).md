## Traits

**Warforged Resilience.** The warforged has advantage on saving throws against being [[poisoned]] and is immune to disease. Magic can't put it to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The warforged makes two armblade attacks.

**Armblade.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Protection.** When an attacker the warforged can see makes an attack roll against a creature within 5 feet of the warforged, the warforged can impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
