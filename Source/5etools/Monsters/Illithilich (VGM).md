**Turn Resistance.** The illithilich has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

## Actions

**Paralyzing Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**3d6**) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h21 (**3d10 + 5**) psychic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or be [[stunned]] until this grapple ends.

**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [[incapacitated]] humanoid [[grappled]] by the lich. @h55 (**10d10**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the lich kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** The illithilich magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 27 (**5d8 + 5**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
