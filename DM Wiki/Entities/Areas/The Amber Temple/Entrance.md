# X2. Entrance

If the characters pass through the archway between the statues, read:

Icy steps descend ten feet to a time-ravaged hallway with arrow slits in the walls. Beyond the hall lies a vast, sepulchral darkness.

The hall connects areas $X 1$ and $X 4$. There are no guards in the rooms behind the arrow slits (areas $X 2 a$ and $X 2 b$ ).

## X2a. Guard Room

This empty room lies behind a secret door. The ceiling is 10 feet high. Two arrow slits are carved into the east wall.

## X2b. Guard Room

This room lies behind a secret door.

Two arrow slits are carved into the west wall of this 10 -foot-high, twenty-foot-square room. Slumped in the northeast corner is a skeleton wearing a blue wizard's robe and clutching a wand to its chest.

The skeleton is all that remains of a wizard who froze to death. It poses no threat.

### Treasure

The skeleton clutches a wand of secrets.
