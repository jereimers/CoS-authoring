## Traits

**Aggressive.** As a bonus action, the orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

**Corrupted Carrier.** When the orc is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes, and any creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (**4d6**) poison damage and becomes [[poisoned]]. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[poisoned]]. A creature [[poisoned]] by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. While [[poisoned]] by this effect, a creature can't regain hit points.

**Nurtured One of Yurtrus.** The orc has advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.


## Actions

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) slashing damage plus 2 (**1d4**) necrotic damage.

**Corrupted Vengeance.** The orc reduces itself to 0 hit points, triggering its Corrupted Carrier trait.
