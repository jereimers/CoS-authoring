## Traits

**Turn Resistance.** The topi has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the topi to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the topi drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Venomous Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) slashing damage plus 2 (**1d4**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the end of the target's next turn.
