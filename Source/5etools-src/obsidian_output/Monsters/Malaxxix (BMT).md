## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Malaxxix fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Malaxxix has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Malaxxix makes two Forge Hammer or Whip attacks in any combination.

**Forge Hammer.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 60/180 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the end of Malaxxix's next turn. @homThe hammer then magically returns to Malaxxix's hand.

**Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) slashing damage, and the target has the [[restrained]] condition for 1 minute. The [[restrained]] target can make a DC 20 Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Only one creature can be [[restrained]] by the whip at a time.

**Mezzoloth Vortex {@recharge 5}.** Malaxxix summons a vortex of whirling mezzoloths at a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. The vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than Malaxxix in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 35 (**10d6**) force damage and has the [[restrained]] condition while within the cylinder. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of Malaxxix's next turn.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Fiendish Stride.** Malaxxix moves up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. When Malaxxix moves within 5 feet of a creature during this movement, that creature takes 5 (**1d10**) lightning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

**Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Malaxxix makes one Forge Hammer or Whip attack.
