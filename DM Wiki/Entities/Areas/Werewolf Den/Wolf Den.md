# Z3. Wolf Den

Nine wolves and a werewolf in human form are here. The werewolf, Skennis, has 36 hit points and is too old to hunt. Left undisturbed, he plays an electrum flute (see "Treasure" below), though not very well. The wolves are huddled behind him and go where he goes. Though well past his prime, he fights to the death to defend the den, and he takes umbrage at anyone who kills any of his wolf allies.

A five-foot-high stone ledge overlooks this large cave, which has a smoldering campfire at the far west end. The floor is covered with gnawed bones.

If Skennis is reduced to 0 hit points, read:

The old man cackles. "When Kiril returns," he says to you with his last breath, "he'll skin you alive."

## Treasure

Skennis's electrum flute is nonmagical and worth 250 gp . Skennis also carries a pouch containing four 50 gp gemstones.
