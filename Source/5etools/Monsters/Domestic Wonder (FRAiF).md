## Traits

**Mechanical Determination.** If damage reduces the wonder to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it makes a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 plus the damage taken unless the damage is Lightning or from a [[Critical Hit|XPHB]]. On a successful save, the wonder drops to 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] instead.

**Wind-Up Operation.** The wonder has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition until another creature winds it with the wonder's unique key for 1 minute. Once wound, the wonder operates for 10 days or until a creature touches the wonder with its key as a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action to deactivate it, after which the wonder has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition until it is wound again.
