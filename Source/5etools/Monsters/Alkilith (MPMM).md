## Traits

**Abyssal Rift.** If the alkilith surrounds a door, window, or similar opening continuously for `6d6` days, the opening becomes a permanent portal to a random layer of the Abyss.

**Amorphous.** The alkilith can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**False Appearance.** If the alkilith is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the alkilith move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the alkilith isn't ordinary slime or fungus.

**Foment Confusion.** Any creature that isn't a demon that starts its turn within 30 feet of the alkilith must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or it hears a faint buzzing in its head for a moment and has disadvantage on its next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.

If the saving throw against Foment Confusion fails by 5 or more, the creature is instead subjected to the [[confusion]] spell for 1 minute (no [[concentration]] required by the alkilith). While under the effect of that confusion, the creature is immune to Foment Confusion.

**Magic Resistance.** The alkilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The alkilith can climb difficult surfaces, such as upside down on ceilings, without making an ability check.

**Unusual Nature.** The alkilith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The alkilith makes three Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h18 (**4d6 + 4**) acid damage.
