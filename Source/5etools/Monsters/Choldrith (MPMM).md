## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The choldrith has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the choldrith to sleep.

**Spider Climb.** The choldrith can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the choldrith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the choldrith knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The choldrith ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) poison damage.

**Web {@recharge 5}.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one Large or smaller creature. @hThe target is [[restrained]] by webbing. As an action, the [[restrained]] target can make a DC 11 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; 5 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).


## Bonus Actions

**Spectral Dagger (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The choldrith conjures a floating, spectral dagger within 60 feet of itself. The choldrith can make a melee spell attack (+4 to hit) against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger. On a hit, the target takes 6 (**1d8 + 2**) force damage.

The dagger lasts for 1 minute. As a bonus action on later turns, the choldrith can move the dagger up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger.
