%% Lore is a bit of history, common knowledge, or confirmed rumor known to be true by in-game entities. It doesn't have to be universally true in order to be considered Lore -- the "redheaded Barovian women bring ill luck" piece of lore isn't literally true, but many in-world NPCs believe it to be true, so it is legitimate Lore. 

Lore is known by people and possibly shared at a particular time/place to various recipients. %%
