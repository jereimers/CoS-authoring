# Explosive Seed

*Item, None*

This acorn-sized sphere of brass contains a small amount of blasting powder and a clockwork trigger. An explosive seed can be thrown up to 30 feet as an action, detonating on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding seed must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking **1d8** bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
