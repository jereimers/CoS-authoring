# Shifter

**Size:** Small, Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Bestial Instincts

Channeling the beast within, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [[Acrobatics|XPHB]], [[Athletics|XPHB]], [[Intimidation|XPHB]], or [[Survival|XPHB]].

## Darkvision

You have [[Darkvision|XPHB]] with a range of 60 feet.

## Shifting

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can shape-shift to assume a more bestial appearance. This transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you revert to your normal appearance as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]]. When you shift, you gain [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to 2 times your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]. You can shift a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

Whenever you shift, you gain the benefit of one of the following options (choose when you select this species)

- **Beasthide:** You gain `1d6` additional [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]]. While shifted, you have a +1 bonus to your [[Armor Class|XPHB]].
- **Longtooth:** When you shift and as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] on your other turns while shifted, you can use your elongated fangs to make an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]]. If you hit with this [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]] and deal damage, you can deal Piercing damage equal to `1d6` plus your Strength modifier, instead of the normal damage of an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]].
- **Swiftstride:** While you are shifted, your [[Speed|XPHB]] increases by 10 feet. Additionally, you can move up to 10 feet as a [[Reaction|XPHB]] when a creature ends its turn within 5 feet of you. This reactive movement doesn't provoke [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]].
- **Wildhunt:** While shifted, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Wisdom checks. Additionally, no creature within 30 feet of you can have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on an attack roll against you unless you have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.
