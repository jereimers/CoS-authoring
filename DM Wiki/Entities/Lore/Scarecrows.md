# What They Are

Scarecrows are animated constructs—straw-stuffed bodies bound to wooden frames and brought to life by dark magic. In [[Barovia]], they serve as guardians and ambush predators.

# What the Party Knows

- Two scarecrows ambushed the party alongside four [[Twig Blights|twig blights]]
- They appeared to be normal scarecrows mounted on tree branches until they suddenly tore themselves free
- Their bodies were hewn of rough straw with weathered cloth clinging to their frames
