# T4. Guard Tower, Ground Floor

The tower door is made of ironbound wood and barred from within. A character can force open the door with a successful DC 22 Strength (Athletics) check.

A cold hearth stands across from the door, the wind howling down its chimney. A stone staircase is on the south wall. Three windows look out over a foggy sea.

The stairs climb 20 feet to area T5.

## Teleport Destination

Characters who teleport to this location from area K78 in Castle Ravenloft arrive at the point marked $X$ on the map.
