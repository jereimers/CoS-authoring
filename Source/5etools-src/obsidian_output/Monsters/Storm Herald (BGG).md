## Traits

**Amphibious.** The herald can breathe air and water.

**Magic Resistance.** The herald has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The herald makes one Claw attack, one Tentacles attack, and one Trident attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d6 + 8**) slashing damage.

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 18). It also has the [[restrained]] condition and takes 16 (**3d10**) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns until this grapple ends. The herald can have only one creature [[grappled]] this way at a time.

**Trident.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d6 + 8**) piercing damage or 21 (**3d8 + 8**) piercing damage if used with two hands, plus 13 (**3d8**) lightning damage.

**Psychic Wave {@recharge}.** The herald unleashes a blast of psionic energy into the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 90 feet of itself. Each target must make a DC 21 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 23 (**3d10 + 7**) psychic damage and has the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this psychic damage, it dies and its head explodes if it has one.
