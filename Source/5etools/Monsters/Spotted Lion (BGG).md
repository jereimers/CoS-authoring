## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** The lion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the lion's allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition.


## Actions

**Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) piercing damage. If the lion moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition. If the target has the [[prone]] condition, the lion can make another Rend attack against it as a bonus action.
