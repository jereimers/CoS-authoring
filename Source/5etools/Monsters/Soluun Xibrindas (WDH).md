## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Soluun has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put Soluun to sleep.

**Gunslinger.** Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on Soluun's ranged attack rolls with a pistol. In addition, Soluun ignores Cover and Cover when making ranged attacks with a pistol.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Soluun has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**Equipment.** Four packets of smokepowder and a pouch containing 20 pistol bullets

**Boots of Elvenkind.** Whilst wearing these boots Soluun's steps make no sound and he has advantage on any Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks that rely on moving silently.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Soluun makes two scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Poisonous Pistol.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) poison damage.
