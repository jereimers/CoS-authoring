# Euryale Card

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

As an action, you can brandish this card at one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and attempt to turn it to stone. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and has the [[restrained]] condition. The affected target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target has the [[petrified]] condition (instead of the [[restrained]] condition) until it is removed by the [[Greater Restoration]] spell or similar magic. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
