You unleash a blast of cold air. Each creature in a 60-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **8d8** Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `8d8` for each spell slot level above 5.
