## Traits

**Charge.** If the moose moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with an antlers attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (**2d8**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Sure-Footed.** The moose has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [[prone]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The moose makes two attacks: one with its antlers and one with its hooves.

**Antlers.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.
