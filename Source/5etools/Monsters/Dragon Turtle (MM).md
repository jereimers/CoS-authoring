## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon turtle can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h26 (**3d12 + 7**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h26 (**3d12 + 7**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked [[prone]].

**Steam Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (**15d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
