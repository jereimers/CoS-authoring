## Traits

**Darkness Dweller.** Attacks made against a bezekira in bright or dim light have disadvantage.

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the bezekira's darkvision.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The bezekira makes three Claw attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with a Bite attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) fire damage. The bezekira deals an extra 28 (**8d6**) fire damage when it hits a target with an attack and has advantage on the attack roll.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, grasping the target with its mouth. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 17). The bezekira can't make a Bite attack while a creature is [[grappled]] in this way.
