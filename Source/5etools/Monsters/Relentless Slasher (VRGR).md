## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day).** If the slasher fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Shrouded Presence.** The slasher is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, and it can't be detected by abilities that sense Fiends.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The slasher makes two Slasher's Knife attacks.

**Slasher's Knife.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) slashing damage plus 21 (**6d6**) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it suffers a lingering wound that causes it to take 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Each time the slasher hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 3 (**1d6**). The wound ends if the target regains hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[Medicine]]) check.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Slice.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Vanishing Strike (Costs 3 Actions).** The slasher makes one Slasher's Knife attack. After the attack hits or misses, the slasher can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
