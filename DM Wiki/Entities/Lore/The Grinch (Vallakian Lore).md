# The Grinch (Vallakian Lore)

The people of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] speak in hushed tones of the creature that dwells upon [[Mt Crumpit]]—when they speak of it at all. These are the stories, rumors, and half-truths that circulate through taverns, guard posts, and children's bedtime warnings.

## What Vallakians Say

The common folk of Vallaki have many theories about the "Green Devil," and few agree on the details:

### Common Rumors
- *"He was a man once, they say. A toymaker who went mad with jealousy when [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] surpassed him."*
- *"He steals from homes on the coldest nights—not coin or food, but hope itself. You wake up and the world seems grayer."*
- *"The Mists birthed him, same as they birth all the monsters in this land."*
- *"He has a hound with eyes like dying embers. If you see the dog, the master isn't far behind."*
- *"He only takes from those who celebrate. That's why some folk don't decorate anymore—not since the disappearances."*

### Contradictions
Vallakians cannot agree on basic facts:
- Some say the Grinch is eight feet tall; others insist he's hunched and small
- Some claim he eats children; others say he only takes their toys
- Some believe he can be reasoned with; others say he kills on sight
- Some think he serves [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]; others believe [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] himself fears the mountain

## What Children Believe

Vallakian children have their own mythology surrounding the Grinch, passed down through generations of whispered stories:

- **"If you're bad, the Green Man will take your toys."** — A common threat from exasperated parents, now treated as genuine warning.
- **"He has a sack that can hold a whole house."** — Children believe the Grinch's sack is bottomless, filled with every toy ever stolen.
- **"His heart is made of ice, and it's two sizes too small."** — A popular saying among older children.
- **"If you're kind to his dog, he might let you go."** — Some children believe [[Max]] is the key to survival.
- **"He cries when no one's watching."** — A rare, sympathetic interpretation, usually dismissed by other children.

## What Guards Believe

The Vallaki town guard has a more practical (if no less superstitious) view:

- **"Something lives up there. We've seen the lights."** — Guards on night watch report flickering lights on Mt. Crumpit's summit.
- **"We don't patrol past the old stones."** — The standing stones at the mountain's midpoint mark an unofficial boundary.
- **"The burgomaster says it's nothing. The burgomaster doesn't walk the walls at midnight."** — Quiet skepticism of official denials.
- **"I saw the dog once. Just... watching. Then it was gone."** — Multiple guards report sightings of Max.
- **"Whatever it is, it's never attacked the town. We leave it alone, it leaves us alone."** — A fragile truce, possibly imagined.

### Official Position
[[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] dismisses stories of the Grinch as "peasant superstition unbecoming of a joyful citizenry." He has forbidden guards from investigating the mountain, calling it a waste of resources.

## What Is Not Known

The people of Vallaki do not know:
- The Grinch's true origins or nature
- That he is potentially redeemable
- That Max is a mist-touched construct, not a natural dog
- That the mountain exists in a Mist-pocket demi-refuge
- That the Grinch's bitterness stems from loneliness, not malice
- That kindness—not violence—is the key to ending his threat
# Truth vs. Rumor

| Rumor | Truth |
|-------|-------|
| He was a jealous toymaker | **Unknown.** The Grinch's origins are lost—possibly true, possibly Mist-fabrication |
| He steals hope itself | **Metaphorically true.** He steals symbols of joy, which has a psychological effect |
| He eats children | **False.** He has never harmed a child; he avoids them |
| He serves Strahd | **False.** The Grinch is unaffiliated and considers Strahd irrelevant |
| Strahd fears the mountain | **False.** Strahd is aware of the anomaly but considers it beneath his notice |
| He's eight feet tall | **False.** He's hunched and medium-sized |
| His heart is too small | **Metaphorically true.** He has suppressed his capacity for connection |
| Max is the key | **True.** Kindness to Max is the fastest path to reaching the Grinch |
| He cries when no one's watching | **True.** Max has seen it |

## How This Lore Evolves After the Quest

### If the Grinch is Slain
- Stories grow darker; the Grinch becomes a true boogeyman
- Children claim to see his ghost on the mountain
- The counting song adds a final verse: *"Eleven, twelve, they sent him to hell"*
- Parents use the story more freely as a threat
- Some claim to hear howling on cold nights (Max's grief)

### If the Grinch is Redeemed
- Initial disbelief, then cautious wonder
- Children's stories shift: *"The Green Man came back, and his heart grew that day"*
- Some Vallakians remain suspicious; others visit Mt. Crumpit out of curiosity
- [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] may commission the story as a new puppet show
- [[The Long Night]] celebrations gain a new tradition: leaving a small gift "for the mountain"

### If the Party Never Engages
- Stories persist unchanged
- The Grinch continues his raids on [[The Long Night]]
- Vallaki's relationship with joy remains complicated
- Some children grow up believing; others dismiss it as myth

## Seeds for Further Engagement

Ways to introduce the Grinch lore to players:
1. **Overheard conversation:** Children chanting the counting song in the town square
2. **Guard's warning:** A nervous guard mentions "the crooked peak" when the party asks about dangers outside town
3. **Blinsky's complaint:** [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] mentions theft from his shop, blaming "that wretched creature from the mountain"
4. **Tavern tale:** A drunk local at the Blue Water Inn shares an embellished story
5. **Child's plea:** A Vallakian child asks the party to retrieve a stolen toy
