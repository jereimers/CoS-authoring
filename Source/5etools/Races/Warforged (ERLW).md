# Warforged

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  
**Ability Score Increase:** CON +2

## Age

A typical warforged is between two and thirty years old. The maximum warforged lifespan remains a mystery; so far, warforged have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging effects.

## Alignment

Most warforged take comfort in order and discipline, tending toward law and neutrality. But some have absorbed the morality, or lack thereof, of the beings with which they served.

## Size

Your size is Medium.

## Constructed Resilience

You were created to have remarkable fortitude, represented by the following benefits:

- You have advantage on saving throws against being [[poisoned]], and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You are immune to disease.
- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep.

## Sentry's Rest

When you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesn't render you [[unconscious]], and you can see and hear as normal.

## Integrated Protection

Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor:

- You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.
- You can don only armor with which you have proficiency. To don armor other than a shield, you must incorporate it into your body over the course of 1 hour, during which you remain in contact with the armor. To doff armor, you must spend 1 hour removing it. You can rest while donning or doffing armor in this way.
- While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can't be removed against your will.

## Specialized Design

You gain one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.

## Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.
