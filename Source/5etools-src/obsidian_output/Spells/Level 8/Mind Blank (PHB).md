Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and the [[charmed]] condition. The spell even foils [[wish]] spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target.
