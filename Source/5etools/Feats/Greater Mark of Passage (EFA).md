# Greater Mark of Passage

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Improved Intuition

When you use the Intuitive Motion benefit of your [[Mark of Passage|EFA]] feat, you can roll `1d6` instead of `1d4`.

## Improved Passage

When you use the Magical Passage benefit of your [[Mark of Passage|EFA]] feat to cast [[Misty Step|XPHB]] without a spell slot, you can also choose up to two willing creatures you can see within 30 feet of yourself before you teleport. Each target can then take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to also teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
