## Traits

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the skeletal knight to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is bludgeoning or from a critical hit. On a success, the skeletal knight drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Unusual Nature.** The skeletal knight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The skeletal knight makes three Enervating Blade or Throwing Axe attacks in any combination.

**Enervating Blade.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of the skeletal knight's next turn.

**Throwing Axe.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) slashing damage.
