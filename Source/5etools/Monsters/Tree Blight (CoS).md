## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the blight remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a dead tree.

**Siege Monster.** The blight deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The blight makes one Branch attack and one Grasping Root attack.

**Branch.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Grasping Root.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature not [[grappled]] by the blight. @hThe target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 9 (**1d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The root has AC 15 and can be severed by dealing 6 slashing damage or more to it at once. Cutting the root doesn't hurt the blight, but ends the grapple.


## Bonus Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature [[grappled]] by the blight. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) piercing damage.
