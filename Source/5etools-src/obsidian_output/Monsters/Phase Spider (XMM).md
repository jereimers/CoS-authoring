**Ethereal Sight.** The spider can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane while on the Material Plane and vice versa.

**Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webs, and the spider knows the location of any other creature in contact with the same web.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spider makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** m +5, reach 5 ft. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) Piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) Poison damage.
