# Overview

Wachterhaus is the ancestral home of the [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Wachter]] family in [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. A thick garden filled with herbs and vines stands beside this wide, red-roofed manor. A slouching roof hangs heavy over furrowed gables, and moss-covered walls sag and bulge under the weight of the vegetation. A handsome red-painted door stands at the house's entrance, its upper half set with frosted glass.

The Wachter family, once an influential noble line in [[Barovia]], owns and occupies this mansion. The house's reigning governess, [[Lady Fiona Wachter]], is rumored to be a critic of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich's]] rule.
