# Menga leaves (1 ounce)

*Item, Unknown*

The dried leaves of a menga bush can be ground, dissolved in a liquid, heated, and ingested. A creature that ingests 1 ounce of menga leaves in this fashion regains 1 hit point. A creature that ingests more than 5 ounces of menga leaves in a 24-hour period gains no additional benefit and must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 hour. The [[unconscious]] creature awakens if it takes at least 5 damage on one turn.

A healthy menga bush usually has `2d6` ounces of leaves. Once picked, the leaves require 1 day to dry out before they can confer any benefit.
