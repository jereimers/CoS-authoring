# Sasha Ivliskova Profile

## Portrait
*No portrait available.*

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Sasha should make the players feel sympathetic toward her clear discomfort as one of Strahd's brides, endeared to her for her efforts to maintain her dignity in the face of dismissal and cruelty from Strahd's other brides, and mildly put off by her standoffish reluctance to allow others to get close to her.

### Emotions
Sasha most often feels melancholy, anxious, despondent, uncomfortable, anguished, reluctant, or fearful. If treated with kindness, she might feel grateful or hopeful.

### Motivations
Sasha is motivated by her desire to avoid Strahd's wrath, protect other vulnerable Barovians from falling under Strahd's thrall, and free herself from the vampiric curse of undeath.

### Inspirations
When roleplaying Sasha, channel Sansa Stark (*Game of Thrones)*), Katniss Everdeen (*The Hunger Games*), and Elsa (*Frozen*).

### Vocal Notes


### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Sasha is a quiet, brooding vampire with little interest in others. To those she trusts, Sasha is a sorrowful, guilt-ridden soul desperate to escape her monstrous existence.

### Morale
In a fight, Sasha would seek to flee or entreat her adversary, fighting only if cornered by an evil or malevolent opponent.

### Relationships
Sasha is Strahd's first bride and a secret friend to Gertruda, Doru's betrothed and Strahd's prisoner.
