# Hidden Trapdoor 

The staircase ends at a landing with a 6-foot-high ceiling of close-fitting planks with a wooden trapdoor set into it. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side and can be pushed open to reveal the den (area 3) above.

## Development

Once the trapdoor has been found and opened, it remains available to characters as a way into and out of the dungeon level.
