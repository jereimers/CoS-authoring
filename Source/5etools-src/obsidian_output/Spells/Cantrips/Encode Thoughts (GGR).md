# Encode Thoughts

*Cantrip enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S  
**Duration:** 8 hours

Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

If you cast this spell while [[concentration]] on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as [[detect thoughts]] or [[modify memory]]), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.

Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting [[detect thoughts]] on the strand has the same effect.)
