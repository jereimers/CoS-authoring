## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe both air and water.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) force damage.

**Singularity Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon creates a shining bead of gravitational force in its mouth, then releases the energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (**5d8**) force damage, and its speed becomes 0 until the start of the dragon's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced.
