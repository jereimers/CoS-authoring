## Traits

**Aura of Blood Thirst.** If the flind isn't [[incapacitated]], any creature with the Rampage trait can make a bite attack as a bonus action while within 10 feet of the flind.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The flind makes three attacks: one with each of its different flail attacks or three with its longbow.

**Flail of Madness.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target must make a melee attack against a random target within its reach on its next turn. If it has no targets within its reach even after moving, it loses its action on that turn.

**Flail of Pain.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (**4d10**) psychic damage.

**Flail of Paralysis.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d8**) piercing damage.
