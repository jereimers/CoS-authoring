# Delicious Pain

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Toughened Flesh

Immediately after you take Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to gain [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage until the start of your next turn. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
