## Traits

**Living Shadow.** While in dim light or darkness, the dragon has resistance to damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Shadow Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales shadowy fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (**16d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies, and an undead [[shadow]] rises from its corpse and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The shadow is under the dragon's control.
