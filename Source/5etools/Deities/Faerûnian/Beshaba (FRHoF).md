# Beshaba

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Beshaba is a god of misfortune, the counterpoint to her benevolent sister, Tymora, and as frequently acknowledged in daily life. Lady Doom is a cruel and capricious god who must be placated to avoid attracting her ruinous attention and interest.

The ancient empire of Netheril revered a single god of luck, Tyche, whose influence extended over both good luck and bad. According to myth, Tyche became corrupted and died, but her essence then manifested in Beshaba and Tymora, two sisters who share influence over Tyche's divine portfolio. Beshaba is petty and spiteful, and her actions and whims seem perplexing even to her followers. When Beshaba speaks directly to a mortal, her voice whispers from broken mirrors. Otherwise, she sends a [[Quasit|XMM]] disguised as a black cat, or a great stag ([[Deer|XMM]], [[Elk|XMM]], or [[Giant Elk|XMM]]) with black antlers dripping blood.

Mortals invoke Beshaba's name when beset by bad luck—anything as minor as stubbing a toe or as catastrophic as falling off a cliff. She is also petitioned to ward off her attentions when sudden bad luck could spell disaster, such as when crossing a rickety bridge. Although people tremble in fear at the prospect of Beshaba's presence at any event (even in spirit), those performing opening speeches or ceremonies at formal functions welcome and propitiate her—after all, if she isn't invited to an event, she might take offense and wreak misfortune on those involved.

Temples to Beshaba are virtually unknown. It's common, however, for rural folk to erect a post and mount antlers on it at the site of a roadside accident or murder. In cities, where antlers are hard to come by, the pious draw the black antlers of Beshaba with charcoal on a nearby wall, leaving the symbol on display until weather scours it away. These makeshift shrines warn others about places of ill fortune.

Beshaba's Chosen are conduits of misfortune. They move throughout the world manipulating people and events to drive disasters, unleash plagues, and let demons slip into the world.
