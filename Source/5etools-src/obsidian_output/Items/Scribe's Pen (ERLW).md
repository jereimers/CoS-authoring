# Scribe's Pen

*Wondrous Item, Common* *(requires attunement by a creature with the Mark of Scribing)*

You can use this pen to write on any surface. You decide whether the writing is visible or [[invisible]], but the writing is always visible to a person with the Mark of Scribing.

Any creature with the Mark of Scribing can use an action to touch the [[invisible]] writing, making it visible to all.

If you use the pen to write on a creature that isn't a construct, the writing fades after 7 days.
