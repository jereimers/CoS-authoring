# Charm of Biting Cold

*Charm*

*This charm can be bestowed by a {@creature chwinga* living in Icewind Dale or other cold regions by using their Magical Gift action.}

This charm has 3 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the charm's charges to wreathe your weapon attacks with biting cold for 1 minute. Until this effect ends, you deal an extra **1d6** cold damage when you hit with a melee or ranged weapon attack. Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.
