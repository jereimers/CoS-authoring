## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The drone can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Unusual Nature.** The drone doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drone makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) lightning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). The drone has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.

**Crystalline Spit {@recharge 5}.** The drone spits crackling gel in a line 5 feet wide and 20 feet long. Each creature in the line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (**4d6**) lightning damage and is [[restrained]] by the gel, which hardens into crystal. The creature is [[restrained]] until the crystal is destroyed. The crystal has AC 15, 15 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[restrained]].
