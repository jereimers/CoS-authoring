## Traits

**Advanced Telepathy.** The flumph can perceive the content of any telepathic communication used within 60 feet of it, and it can't be [[surprised]] by creatures with any form of telepathy.

**Prone Deficiency.** If the flumph is knocked [[prone]], roll a die. On an odd result, the flumph lands upside-down and is [[incapacitated]]. At the end of each of its turns, the flumph can make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, righting itself and ending the [[incapacitated]] condition if it succeeds.

**Telepathic Shroud.** The flumph is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as all divination spells.


## Actions

**Tendrils.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage plus 2 (**1d4**) acid damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 2 (**1d4**) acid damage on a failure or ending the recurring acid damage on a success. A [[lesser restoration]] spell cast on the target also ends the recurring acid damage.

**Stench Spray (1/Day).** Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from the flumph must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in a foul-smelling liquid. A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for `1d4` hours. The coated creature is [[poisoned]] as long as the stench lasts, and other creatures are [[poisoned]] while with in 5 feet of the coated creature. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.
