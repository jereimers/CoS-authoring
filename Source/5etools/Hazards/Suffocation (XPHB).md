# Suffocation

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 plus its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins. When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it gains 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level at the end of each of its turns. When a creature can breathe again, it removes all levels of [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] it gained from suffocating.
