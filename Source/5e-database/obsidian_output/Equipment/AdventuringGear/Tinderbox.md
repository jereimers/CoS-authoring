# Tinderbox

*Adventuring Gear*

**Cost:** 5 sp
**Weight:** 1 lb.

This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch--or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel--takes an action.

Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.
