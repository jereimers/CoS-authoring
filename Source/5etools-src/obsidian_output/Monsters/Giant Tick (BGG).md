## Actions

**Proboscis.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage, and the tick attaches to the target. While attached, the tick can't make Proboscis attacks. The tick can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. As an action, a creature within reach of the tick can try to detach the tick, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength check.

**Blood Drain.** The tick deals 10 (**2d6 + 3**) necrotic damage to one creature it is physically attached to, provided that creature isn't a Construct or an Undead, or 17 (**4d6 + 3**) necrotic damage if the creature is a Giant. The tick regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.
