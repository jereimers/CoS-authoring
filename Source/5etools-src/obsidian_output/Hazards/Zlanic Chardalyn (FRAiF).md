# Zlanic Chardalyn

When [[Zlan|FRAiF]] focuses on a piece of chardalyn, the material becomes charged with negative energy and acts as a conduit for Zlan's will. A creature touching chardalyn charged in this way makes a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is subject to one of the following effects (DM's choice), each of which ends 1 minute after the creature ceases to touch the stone:

- The creature has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition.
- The creature has the [[Stunned|XPHB]] condition.
- The creature is [[Charmed|XPHB]] by Zlan and regards anyone who would separate it from the chardalyn as an enemy.
