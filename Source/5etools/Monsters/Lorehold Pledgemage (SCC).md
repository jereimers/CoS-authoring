## Actions

**Multiattack.** The pledgemage makes two Scroll Bash attacks.

**Scroll Bash.** Melee Spell Attack +5 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (**2d8**) thunder damage.

**Reduce to Memory {@recharge 5}.** Thundering golden energy erupts around a creature the pledgemage can see within 90 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (**8d10**) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has disadvantage on the saving throw.


## Bonus Actions

**Chronal Break (1/Day).** The pledgemage chooses a point within 30 feet of itself, shunting the minds of nearby creatures out of this moment in time. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[incapacitated]] until the end of the pledgemage's next turn.


## Reactions

**Learn from the Past (2/Day).** When another creature within 60 feet of the pledgemage misses a target with an attack roll, the pledgemage magically enables the attacker to reroll the attack roll. It must use the new roll.
