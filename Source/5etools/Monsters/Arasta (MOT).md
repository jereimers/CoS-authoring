## Traits

**Armor of Spiders (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If Arasta is reduced to 0 hit points, she doesn't die or fall [[unconscious]]. Instead, she regains 200 hit points. In addition, Arasta's children immediately swarm over her body to protect her, granting her 100 temporary hit points.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Arasta fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Arasta has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** Arasta can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Walker.** Arasta ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Arasta makes three attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 32 (**5d12**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d6 + 7**) slashing damage.

**Web of Hair {@recharge 4}.** Arasta unleashes her hair in the form of webbing that fills a 30-foot cube next to her. The web is difficult terrain, its area is lightly obscured, and it lasts for 1 minute. Any creature that moves into the web or that starts its turn there must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[restrained]] while in the web. A creature can use an action to make a DC 21 Strength check. On a success, it can free itself or a creature within 5 feet of it that is [[restrained]] by the web. This webbing is immune to all damage except magical fire. A 5-foot cube of the web is destroyed if it takes at least 20 fire damage from a spell or other magical source on a single turn.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Claws.** Arasta makes one attack with her claws.

**Swarm (Costs 2 Actions).** Arasta causes two [[swarm of spiders|]] to appear in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of her.

**Toxic Web (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature [[restrained]] by Arasta's Web of Hair takes 18 (**4d8**) poison damage.
