## Traits

**Assassinate.** During its first turn, the hybrid poisoner has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the hybrid scores against a [[surprised]] creature is a critical hit.

**Poisonous Skin.** Any creature that touches the hybrid or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (**1d6**) poison damage.


## Actions

**Toxic Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**2d6**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. At the end of each of the [[poisoned]] target's turns, it must repeat the save, taking 3 (**1d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or ending the effect on itself on a successful one.
