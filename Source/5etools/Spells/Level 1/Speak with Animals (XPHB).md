# Speak with Animals

*1st-level divination (ritual)*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

---

For the duration, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with Beasts, and you can use any of the [[Influence|XPHB]] action's skill options with them.

Most Beasts have little to say about topics that don't pertain to survival or companionship, but at minimum, a Beast can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever it has perceived within the past day.
