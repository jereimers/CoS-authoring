## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d4 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Cloak of the Mountain {@recharge 4}.** The wynling magically turns [[invisible]], along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, for 1 minute or until it makes an attack roll.



## Reactions

**Trickster's Flight.** Immediately after a creature the wynling can see misses the wynling with an attack roll, the wynling can move up to 30 feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
