# Shadowbark

Netheril's flying cities cast huge shadows over the ground below, sometimes cutting off trees from the sunlight for weeks or months. Due to the magic emanating from these flying cities, the trees below sometimes generate shadowbark: a purple-and-black, moss-like coating that looks like a splotchy bruise.

Any creature that enters a space within 5 feet of shadowbark for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (`1d10`) Necrotic damage and can't regain Hit Points until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

Any amount of Radiant damage destroys shadowbark instantly.

## At Higher Levels

Shadowbark can spread quickly in a forest, growing in strength. You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Necrotic damage and save DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Necrotic Damage | Save DC |
|---|---|---|
| 5–10 | 11 (`2d10`) | 14 |
| 11–16 | 22 (`4d10`) | 16 |
| 17–20 | 55 (`10d10`) | 18 |
