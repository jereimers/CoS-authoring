# Holy Star of Mystra

*8th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a glowing mote of energy that hovers above you for the duration. The mote sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 5-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 5 feet.

When you cast this spell and as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] on later turns, you can unleash a shining bolt from the mote, targeting one creature within 120 feet of yourself. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes Force or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to `4d10` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

In addition, while the mote is present, you have [[Cover|XPHB]], and if you succeed on a saving throw against a spell of level 7 or lower that targeted only you and didn't create an area of effect, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to deflect that spell back at the spell's caster; the caster makes a saving throw against that spell using that caster's own spell save DC.
