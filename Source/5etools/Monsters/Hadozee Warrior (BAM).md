## Traits

**Glide.** If it isn't [[incapacitated]] or wearing heavy armor, the hadozee can extend its skin membranes to move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends in the air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hadozee makes two Shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Safe Descent.** When it would take damage from a fall, the hadozee extends its skin membranes to reduce the fall's damage to 0, provided it isn't wearing heavy armor.

**Uncanny Dodge.** The hadozee halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it, provided it can see the attacker.
