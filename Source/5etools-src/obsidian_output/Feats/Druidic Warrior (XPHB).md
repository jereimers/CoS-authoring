# Druidic Warrior

You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice. [[Guidance|XPHB]] and [[Starry Wisp|XPHB]] are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.
