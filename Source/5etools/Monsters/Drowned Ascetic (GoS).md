## Traits

**Bottom Treader.** The drowned ascetic cannot swim, and it sinks to the bottom of any body of water. It takes no penalties to its movement or attacks underwater. It is immune to the effects of being underwater at a depth greater than 100 feet.

**Bound Together.** The drowned ascetic shares its mind with every other drowned one within 1 mile of it, and can communicate its thoughts and observations to them instantaneously and without limitation.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the drowned ascetic to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the drowned ascetic drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drowned ascetic makes three unarmed strikes.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract [[bluerot|GoS]] (see the "Bluerot" in notes).



## Reactions

**Dexterous Target.** The drowned ascetic adds 3 to its AC against one ranged attack that would hit it. To do so, the drowned ascetic must see the attacker.
