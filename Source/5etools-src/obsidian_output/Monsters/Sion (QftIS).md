## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** Sion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects if he is in dim light or darkness.

**Shadesight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede Sion's darkvision.

**Shadowy Demise.** If Sion dies, his body melts into shadow, leaving behind only equipment he was wearing or carrying.

**Sunlight Weakness.** While in sunlight, Sion has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Sion makes one Shadow Sword attack and uses Affix Shadow or Spellcasting.

**Shadow Sword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) necrotic damage.

**Affix Shadow.** Sion targets a creature within 60 feet of himself that he can see. That target must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 13) as its shadow wraps around it. Once the target escapes the grapple, its shadow returns to normal.


## Bonus Actions

**Shadow Step.** While Sion is in dim light or darkness, he magically teleports up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space he can see that is also in dim light or darkness.
