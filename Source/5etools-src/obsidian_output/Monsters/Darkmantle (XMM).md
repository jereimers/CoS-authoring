## Actions

**Crush.** m +5, reach 5 ft. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) Bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the target. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and the darkmantle had [[Advantage|XPHB]] on the attack roll, it covers the target, which has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition and is suffocating while the darkmantle is attached in this way.

While attached to a target, the darkmantle can attack only the target but has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on its attack rolls. Its [[Speed|XPHB]] becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its [[Speed|XPHB]], and it moves with the target.

A creature can take an action to try to detach the darkmantle from itself, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself by using 5 feet of movement.

**Darkness Aura (1/Day).** Magical [[Darkness|XPHB]] fills a 15-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the darkmantle. This effect lasts while the darkmantle maintains [[Concentration]] on it, up to 10 minutes. Darkvision can't penetrate this area, and no light can illuminate it.
