# Exhaustion

While you have the Exhaustion condition, you experience the following effects.

### Exhaustion Levels

This condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.

### D20 Tests Affected

When you make a D20 Test the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.

### Speed Reduced

Your [[Speed|XPHB]] is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.

### Removing Exhaustion Levels

Finishing a [[Long Rest|XPHB]] removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.
