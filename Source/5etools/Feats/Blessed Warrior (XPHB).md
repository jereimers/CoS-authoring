# Blessed Warrior

You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice. [[Guidance|XPHB]] and [[Sacred Flame|XPHB]] are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.
