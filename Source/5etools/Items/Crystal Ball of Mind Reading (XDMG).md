# Crystal Ball of Mind Reading

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [[Scrying|XPHB]] (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can cast [[Detect Thoughts|XPHB]] (save DC 17) targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [[Detect Thoughts|XPHB]] spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if the [[Scrying|XPHB]] spell ends.
