## Traits

**Crushing End.** If damage reduces Shemshime to 0 hit points, Shemshime instead drops to 1 hit point unless the damage is the result of Shemshime being crushed by an object weighing at least 1,000 pounds.

**Incorporeal Movement.** Shemshime can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.


## Actions

**Maddening Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**4d6 + 3**) psychic damage.

**Whispers of Violence.** Shemshime chooses up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or that target takes 7 (**1d8 + 3**) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature it can reach (Shemshime's choice) that Shemshime can see.

**Howling Babble {@recharge}.** Shemshime targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 21 (**4d8 + 3**) psychic damage and is [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [[stunned]].
