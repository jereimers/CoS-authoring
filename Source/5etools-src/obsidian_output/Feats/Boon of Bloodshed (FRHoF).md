# Boon of Bloodshed

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Killer's Fortune

When an enemy you can see is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], you gain [[Advantage|XPHB]] on the next attack roll you make before the end of your next turn.

## Power from Pain

Once per turn, when you make an attack roll while [[Bloodied]], you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]. The extra damage's type is the same as the attack's type.
