## Traits

**Gatekeeper's Aura.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the phylaskia must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the phylaskia to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the phylaskia drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Vigilant.** The phylaskia can't be [[surprised]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The phylaskia makes two longsword attacks and uses its Strength Drain once.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) slashing damage, or 16 (**2d10 + 5**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 11 (**2d10**) necrotic damage.

**Strength Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) necrotic damage. Unless the target is immune to necrotic damage, its Strength score is reduced by `1d4`. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.
