# Minotaur

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Horns

You have horns that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals **1d6** + your Strength modifier piercing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

## Goring Rush

Immediately after you take the [[Dash]] action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your Horns as a bonus action.

## Hammering Horns

Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to push that target with your horns. The target must be within 5 feet of you and no more than one size larger than you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you can push it up to 10 feet away from you.

## Labyrinthine Recall

You always know which direction is north, and you have advantage on any Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check you make to navigate or track.
