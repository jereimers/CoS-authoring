## Traits

**Roleplaying Information.** Othovir is a gifted harness-maker who doesn't talk about his family or where he came from. He cares about his business, his clients, and his good name.

Ideal: "Find what you do well, and do it to the best of your ability."

Bond: "I won't allow my name to be tarnished."

Flaw: "I get angry when others pry into my private life."


## Actions

**Rapier.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d8**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** Othovir adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, Othovir must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
