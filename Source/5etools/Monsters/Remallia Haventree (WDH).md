## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Remallia has a [[Figurine of Wondrous Power, Silver Raven|]].

**Fey Ancestry.** Remallia has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put her to sleep.

**Arcane Ward.** Remallia has a magical ward that has 30 hit points. Whenever she takes damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If the ward is reduced to 0 hit points, Remallia takes any remaining damage. When Remallia casts an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level of the spell. This applies to any of the following spells she casts: [[alarm]], [[mage armor]], [[shield]], [[arcane lock]], [[counterspell]], [[dispel magic]], [[banishment]], [[stoneskin]], [[globe of invulnerability]] and [[symbol]].


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.
