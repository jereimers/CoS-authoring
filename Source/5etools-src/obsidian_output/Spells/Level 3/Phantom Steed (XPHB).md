# Phantom Steed

*3rd-level illusion (ritual)*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

---

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the [[Riding Horse|XMM]] stat block, except it has a [[Speed|XPHB]] of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.
