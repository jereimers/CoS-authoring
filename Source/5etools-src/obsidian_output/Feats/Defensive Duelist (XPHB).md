# Defensive Duelist

**Prerequisites:** Level 4, DEX 13+

You gain the following benefits.

## Parry

If you're holding a Finesse weapon and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to add your [[Proficiency|XPHB]] to your [[Armor Class|XPHB]], potentially causing the attack to miss you. You gain this bonus to your AC against melee attacks until the start of your next turn.
