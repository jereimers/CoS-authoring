## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Strahd fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Master of the House.** When Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points, he dissolves into mist and immediately teleports to his lair in Castle Ravenloft. After `1d4` hours, Strahd re-forms in a random unoccupied space within his lair, regaining all his hit points.

**Regeneration.** Strahd regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point. If he takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn.

**Spider Climb.** Strahd can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Vampire Weaknesses.** Strahd has the following flaws:

- While in running water, Strahd takes 20 acid damage if he ends his turn there, and he can't use his Change Shape.
- While in sunlight, Strahd takes 20 radiant damage at the start of his turn, has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't use his Change Shape bonus action.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Strahd makes two Death Strike attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with Blighted Fire if available.

**Death Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, Strahd can forgo dealing slashing damage; the target then has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 18) instead. Strahd can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Blighted Fire {@recharge 5}.** Strahd summons shadowy, necrotic fire that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point he can see within 90 feet of himself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (**4d6**) fire damage plus 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Charm.** Strahd targets one Humanoid he can see within 30 feet of himself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[charmed]] condition. The [[charmed]] target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way.

Each time Strahd or his companions deal damage to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or uses a bonus action to end the effect.


## Bonus Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature that has the [[charmed]] or [[grappled]] condition. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Strahd regains a number of hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. A Humanoid slain in this way and then buried rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Strahd's control.

**Change Shape.** Strahd transforms into a new form or back into his true form. Anything he is wearing transforms with him, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies. When transforming into a new form, Strahd chooses one of the following options:

**Beast Form.** Strahd transforms into a Tiny bat (flying speed 30 ft.) or a Medium wolf (speed 40 ft.). While in that form, he can't speak, and he retains his game statistics other than his size and speed.

**Mist Form.** Strahd transforms into a Medium cloud of mist. While in this form, Strahd has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. While in mist form, Strahd can pass through a space without squeezing as long as air can pass through that space, but he can't pass through water. Strahd has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and he is immune to all nonmagical damage except the damage he takes as part of his Vampire Weaknesses trait. While in mist form, Strahd can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Cunning Escape.** Strahd moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Strike (Costs 2 Actions).** Strahd makes one Death Strike attack.
