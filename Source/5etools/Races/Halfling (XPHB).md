# Halfling

**Size:** Small  
**Speed:** 30  

## Brave

You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition.

## Halfling Nimbleness

You can move through the space of any creature that is a size larger than you, but you can't stop in the same space.

## Luck

When you roll a 1 on the `d20` of a [[D20 Test|XPHB]], you can reroll the die, and you must use the new roll.

## Naturally Stealthy

You can take the [[Hide|XPHB]] action even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.
