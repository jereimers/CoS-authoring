# Objective

Find a cure for [[Parriwimple]]'s lycanthropy before the next full moon forces his first transformation.

# What the Party Knows

## The Infection

During the werewolf attack at [[Lake Zarovich]] in [[Session 08 - Hairy Bill, Bairy Hill, and a Coin for the Ladies Three|Session 08]], [[Parriwimple]] was wounded by one of the werewolves the party nicknamed "Hairy Bill" and "Bairy Hill."

When the werewolves died, their monstrous forms peeled away to reveal two young Barovian men—victims of the curse themselves. One of them bore a fresh, angry wound identical to the one now streaked across Parriwimple's shoulder.

**The party knows what this means:** Parriwimple has been infected with lycanthropy. When the next full moon rises, he will transform into a werewolf unless a cure can be found.

## Lycanthropy in Barovia

From their brief time in this cursed valley, the party has learned that lycanthropy is not merely a disease but a curse—one that transforms its victims into savage beasts under the full moon. Those infected can pass the curse through their bites and claws, creating more werewolves with each attack.

The werewolves at Lake Zarovich were gaunt and ravenous, driven by bloodlust. If Parriwimple transforms, he could pose a deadly threat to himself and everyone around him—especially the refugees from the [[Village of Barovia]] camped outside [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s gates.

## Parriwimple's Current State

As of [[Session 08 - Hairy Bill, Bairy Hill, and a Coin for the Ladies Three|Session 08]], Parriwimple is still in his human form, but the party shares uneasy glances whenever they see the wound on his shoulder. He's currently staying at the [[Refugee Camp]] outside Vallaki with other displaced Barovians from his home village.

Time is running out. The next full moon will have its say.

## Magical Cures

Like many supernatural afflictions, lycanthropy may be curable through powerful magic:

- **Remove Curse Spell:** Similar to [[Doru]]'s vampiric affliction, lycanthropy can potentially be lifted by a *remove curse* spell cast by a sufficiently powerful spellcaster (5th level or higher). However, finding a cleric or mage with that capability in Barovia may prove difficult.

- **Other Methods:** There may be other cures known to those who have dealt with lycanthropy before. Werewolf hunters, experienced priests, or ancient texts might hold the key.

## Potential Resources

- **[[St. Andral's Church]] in Vallaki:** [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] may have knowledge of lycanthropy and its cures, or know of others who do. However, he may not be powerful enough to cast *remove curse* himself.

- **[[Lady Fiona Wachter]]:** A woman of arcane knowledge who has studied with witches. She may know of cures or at least point the party in the right direction.

- **[[Victor Vallakovich]]:** A young mage with access to [[Khazan]]'s spellbook. He might know of magical remedies or rituals.

- **Local Hunters:** [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Grilkov]] are wolf hunters who patrol the wilderness around Vallaki. They may have encountered werewolves before and know how to deal with the curse.

- **Ancient Texts:** The [[DM Wiki/Entities/Areas/Town of Vallaki/Burgomaster's Mansion|Vallakovich Manor]]'s extensive library or other repositories of knowledge in Barovia might contain information about lycanthropy and its treatment.

## Timeline Concerns

**The party needs to act before the next full moon.** Once Parriwimple transforms for the first time, curing him may become significantly more difficult—and the danger he poses will become immediate and deadly.

Additionally, Parriwimple is staying in the [[Refugee Camp]] among dozens of vulnerable, displaced Barovians. If he transforms there, the casualties could be catastrophic.

# Secrets

## Cure Information
- Lycanthropy can be cured by a *remove curse* spell (3rd-level spell) cast by a 5th-level or higher caster
- The curse can only be removed before the character transforms under a full moon for the first time; after the first transformation, the lycanthropy becomes permanent and can only be lifted by a *wish* spell
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] is not high enough level to cast *remove curse*
- The party will need to find another source: [[Victor Vallakovich]] may eventually be able to help, or they may need to seek out other powerful spellcasters in Barovia
- Alternatively, the party themselves may gain access to *remove curse* as they level up ([[Arden Nalero|Arden]] will be able to cast it at 5th level as a paladin, [[Choppy Gibbles|Choppy]] at 5th level as a wizard)

## Werewolf Lore
- The werewolves of Barovia are cursed by the land itself and are particularly vicious
- They serve as agents of Barovia's darkness, spreading fear and chaos
- Some werewolves retain their consciousness and can control their transformations—but newly infected victims like Parriwimple will not have this control

## Timing
- The DM should track the lunar cycle; the party has until the next full moon to cure Parriwimple
- If uncured, Parriwimple will transform and potentially attack the refugees at the camp—creating a moral dilemma for the party about whether to protect innocents by restraining or killing their friend
