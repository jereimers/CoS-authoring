## Traits

**Annihilating Aura.** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the nightwalker must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage and grant the nightwalker advantage on attack rolls against it until the start of the creature's next turn. Undead are immune to this aura.

**Life Eater.** A creature reduced to 0 hit points from damage dealt by the nightwalker dies and can't be revived by any means short of a [[wish]] spell.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nightwalker uses Enervating Focus twice, or it uses Enervating Focus and Finger of Doom, if available.

**Enervating Focus.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h28 (**5d8 + 6**) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

**Finger of Doom {@recharge}.** The nightwalker points at one creature it can see within 300 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (**4d12**) necrotic damage and become [[frightened]] until the end of the nightwalker's next turn. While [[frightened]] in this way, the creature is also [[paralyzed]]. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the nightwalker's Finger of Doom for the next 24 hours.
