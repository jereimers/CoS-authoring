# Blessing of Unearned Riches

*Blessing*

The next time you search among or retrieve something from your belongings, you find an unmarked [[pouch|PHB]] containing five 1,000 gp gemstones.

## Consequence

The character's new fortune garners unwanted attention from a guild of violent mercenaries, who claim to have been robbed of exactly 5,000 gp worth of gems the same day as the character found the windfall. Every night for the next 7 days, the character is attacked by `1d4` neutral evil [[Veteran|]]. When the attacks end, so does this blessing.
