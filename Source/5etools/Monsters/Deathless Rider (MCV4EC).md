## Traits

**Mounted Adept.** While mounted and without the [[incapacitated]] condition, the rider has advantage on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature smaller than its mount, the rider and its mount have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and the rider can force an attack targeted at its mount to target the rider instead.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the rider to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the rider drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The rider makes two Axe attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Fell Glare.

**Axe.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Fell Glare.** The rider gazes at a creature within 30 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[frightened]] condition for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see the rider, ending the condition on itself on a success.
