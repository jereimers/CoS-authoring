# Orc

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Adrenaline Rush

You can take the [[Dash|XPHB]] action as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]]. When you do so, you gain a number of [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]].

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Darkvision

You have [[Darkvision|XPHB]] with a range of 120 feet.

## Relentless Endurance

When you are reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] instead. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
