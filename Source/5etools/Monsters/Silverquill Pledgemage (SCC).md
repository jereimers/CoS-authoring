## Actions

**Ink Blade.** Attack (ms,rs) +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Demotivate (2/Day).** The pledgemage hurls magical insults at one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of the pledgemage for 1 minute. While [[frightened]] in this way, the target can't take reactions, its speed is halved, and any hit the pledgemage scores against the creature is a critical hit. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Reactions

**Rousing Verse.** When a creature the pledgemage can see within 30 feet of it fails a saving throw, the pledgemage magically weaves together stirring prose, allowing the creature to reroll the saving throw and use the higher result.
