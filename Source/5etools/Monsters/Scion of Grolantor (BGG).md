## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (6/Day).** If the scion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The scion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The scion deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The scion makes one Great Tree Club attack and two Slam attacks, or it makes three Boulder attacks.

**Great Tree Club.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h30 (**4d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be pushed horizontally up to 100 feet straight away from the scion and have the [[prone]] condition.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h26 (**4d8 + 8**) force damage.

**Boulder.** Ranged Weapon Attack +15 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. @h27 (**3d12 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.

**Inhale {@recharge 5}.** The scion inhales a vortex of air in a 120-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in that area that is Huge or smaller must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 120 feet straight toward the scion and be swallowed. A swallowed creature has the [[restrained]] condition, has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the scion, and takes 24 (**7d6**) force damage at the start of each of the scion's turns.

The scion's stomach can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the scion takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scion must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the scion and has the [[prone]] condition. If the scion dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the [[restrained]] condition and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting with the [[prone]] condition.


## Bonus Actions

**Earth-Shaking Movement.** The scion moves up to its speed and then sends a shock wave through the ground in a 60-foot-radius circle centered on itself. Each creature on the ground in that area that is [[concentration]] must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or lose [[concentration]].


## Reactions

**Feed.** Immediately after taking damage, if it has at least one creature swallowed, the scion deals 10 (**3d6**) force damage to each swallowed creature and regains 10 hit points.
