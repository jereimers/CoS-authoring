## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe both air and water.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d10 + 8**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) force damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d6 + 8**) slashing damage.

**Singularity Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon creates a shining bead of gravitational force in its mouth, then releases the energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 63 (**14d8**) force damage, and its speed becomes 0 until the start of the dragon's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced.


## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The dragon magically transforms into any creature that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.

**Psychic Step.** The dragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Claw.** The dragon makes one claw attack.

**Psionics (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon uses Psychic Step or Spellcasting.

**Explosive Crystal (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon spits an amethyst that that explodes at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (**4d8**) force damage and be knocked [[prone]].
