# Objective
Escape this accursed domain and return home, by any means necessary.

# What the Party knows
- The party found themselves transported into Barovia by various means; Arden and Fig by a mist-waylaid stagecoach journey, Varnish haplessly while wandering on foot, and Choppy by a fluke teleportation spell.
- Near the [[Village of Barovia]], the party found the corpse of a man named Dalvan Olensky carrying a letter from [[Kolyan Indirovich]]. 
- The Mists surrounding Barovia are impenetrable. Those who enter them emerge in unfamiliar parts of the woods, drained of strength. The compass the party found on Dalvan's corpse spins uselessly when near the Mists.
- [[Madam Eva]] performed a Tarokka reading for the party, foretelling the locations of three artifacts and an ally destined to help them defeat [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]]. She warned that the path ends only "when your foe is vanquished—or you are."
- The spirits of the dead march each night from a graveyard near the River Ivlis Crossroads toward Castle Ravenloft—all adventurers who tried and failed to defeat Strahd.

# Leads
- [[Madam Eva]]'s Tarokka reading pointed to three artifacts and an ally who will help defeat Strahd—the only apparent path to freedom.
- [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]] is the master of this domain. Defeating him may be the key to escaping the Mists.
- The Order of the Silver Dragon at [[Argynvostholt]] may have knowledge of how to oppose Strahd.

# Secrets
- Barovia is a "Domain of Dread" within the Shadowfell, ruled by Strahd von Zarovich as its "Darklord." The Mists are a prison created by the Dark Powers that holds Strahd—and all who enter—captive.
- The only way to truly escape Barovia is to destroy Strahd von Zarovich. Even then, the Mists may only part temporarily.
- The three artifacts foretold by Madam Eva are the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*, the *Sunsword*, and the *Tome of Strahd*—each a powerful tool against the vampire lord.
- Strahd has been defeated before, but he always returns. Breaking the cycle permanently may require more than simply killing him.
