## Traits

**Amorphous.** The jelly can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.

**Spider Climb.** The jelly can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Pseudopod.** m +4, reach 5 ft. @h12 (**3d6 + 2**) Acid damage.



## Reactions

**Split.** @actTrigger While the jelly is Large or Medium and has 10+ [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it becomes [[Bloodied]] or is subjected to Lightning or Slashing damage. @actResponse The jelly splits into two new Ochre Jellies. Each new jelly is one size smaller than the original jelly and acts on its [[Initiative|XPHB]]. The original jelly's [[Hit Points|XPHB]] are divided evenly between the new jellies (round down).
