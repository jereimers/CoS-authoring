# Candle of Invocation

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a [[Magic|XPHB]] action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds [[Dim Light|XPHB]] in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on [[D20 Test|XPHB]]. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast [[Gate|XPHB]] with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.

| 1d100 | Outer Plane |
|---|---|
| 01-05 | [[Abyss|XDMG]] |
| 06-10 | [[Acheron|XDMG]] |
| 11-17 | [[Arborea|XDMG]] |
| 18-25 | [[Arcadia|XDMG]] |
| 26-33 | [[Beastlands|XDMG]] |
| 34-41 | [[Bytopia|XDMG]] |
| 42-46 | [[Carceri|XDMG]] |
| 47-54 | [[Elysium|XDMG]] |
| 55-59 | [[Gehenna|XDMG]] |
| 60-64 | [[Hades|XDMG]] |
| 65-69 | [[Limbo|XDMG]] |
| 70-77 | [[Mechanus|XDMG]] |
| 78-85 | [[Mount Celestia|XDMG]] |
| 86-90 | [[Nine Hells|XDMG]] |
| 91-95 | [[Pandemonium|XDMG]] |
| 96-00 | [[Ysgard|XDMG]] |
