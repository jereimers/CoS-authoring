**Range:** Touch

You touch one willing creature, and choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. Until the spell ends, the target can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to exhale a 15-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d6** damage of the chosen type on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 2.
