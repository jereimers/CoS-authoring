# Mark of Detection

You gain the following benefits.

## Deductive Intuition

When you make an Intelligence ([[Investigation|XPHB]]) or Wisdom ([[Insight|XPHB]]) check, you can roll `1d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

## Magical Detection

You always have the [[Detect Magic|XPHB]] and [[Detect Poison and Disease|XPHB]] spells prepared. You can cast each spell once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this feat).

When you reach character level 3, you also always have the [[See Invisibility|XPHB]] spell prepared and can cast it the same way.

## Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Detection Spells table are added to that feature's spell list.
