# Charm of the Adamant

*Charm*

This charm has 9 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge from the charm to gain 30 temporary hit points. For the next hour, your eyes become voids of utter darkness, and you can't be [[charmed]] or [[frightened]]. Once all its charges have been expended, the charm vanishes from you.
