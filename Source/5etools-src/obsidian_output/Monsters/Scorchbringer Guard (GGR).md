## Traits

**Explosive Tank.** When the guard dies, or if it rolls a 1 when checking whether its Scorchbringer action recharges, the tank on its back explodes in a 10-foot radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (**2d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the scorchbringer.


## Actions

**Light Hammer.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Scorchbringer {@recharge 4}.** The guard's scorchbringer spouts a stream of flame in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (**2d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
