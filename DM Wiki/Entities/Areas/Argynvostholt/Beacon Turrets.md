# Q52. Beacon Turrets 

A stone battlement encloses the roof of this turret. A spiral staircase descends to the level below.

These turret rooftops are 80 feet above ground level. The spiral stairs descend 20 feet to archers' posts - small rooms lined with arrow slits. Standing guard in each of these rooms is a phantom warrior (see appendix D) with a spectral longbow that shoots arrows of force energy. The two phantom warriors gain the following action options:

**Multiattack.** The phantom warrior makes two attacks with its spectral longsword or spectral longbow.
**Spectral Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d8) force damage.
