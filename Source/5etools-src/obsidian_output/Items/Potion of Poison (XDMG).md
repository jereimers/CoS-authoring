# Potion of Poison

*Item, Uncommon*

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [[Potion of Healing|XDMG]] or another beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. [[Identify|XPHB]] reveals its true nature.

If you drink this potion, you take **4d6** Poison damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition for 1 hour.
