Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes **1d8** lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by **1d8** when you reach 5th level (**2d8**), 11th level (**3d8**), and 17th level (**4d8**).
