**Vampiric Connection.** While the familiar and its vampire master are on the same plane of existence, the vampire can communicate with the familiar telepathically, and the vampire can perceive through the familiar's senses.

**Umbral Dagger.** m,r +5, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) Piercing damage plus 7 (**3d4**) Necrotic damage.

While it has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition, the target has the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition.


## Bonus Actions

**Deathless Agility.** The familiar takes the Dash or Disengage action.
