# Ball bearings (bag of 1,000)

*Adventuring Gear*

**Cost:** 1 gp
**Weight:** 2 lb.

As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side.

A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.
