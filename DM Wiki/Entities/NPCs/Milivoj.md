Milivoj wants to provide for himself and his siblings.

### Inspirations
When playing Milivoj, channel Katniss Everdeen (*The Hunger Games*), Arya Stark (*Game of Thrones*), and Carl Fredericksen (*Up*).

## Character Information

### Persona
To strangers, Milivoj is a quiet, gruff, and hardworking groundskeeper. To those he trusts, Milivoj is a loving and dedicated elder sibling, a frustrated and bitter son, and a desperate and confused young man.

### Morale
In a fight, Milivoj would brandish his shovel in an attempt to get his attacker to back down, but would quickly surrender if seriously wounded. (If defending his siblings, however, Milivoj would fiercely and gladly fight to the death.)

### Relationships
Milivoj is employed by [[Father Lucian Petrovich]], secretly works for the coffin maker Henrik van der Voort, and is the eldest of nine children belonging to Oleg and Jarzinka, two dream pastry-addicted Vallakians.
