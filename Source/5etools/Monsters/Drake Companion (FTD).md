## Traits

**Draconic Essence.** When you summon the drake, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. The chosen type determines the drake's damage immunity and the damage of its Infused Strikes trait.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 plus PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h**1d6** plus PB piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Infused Strikes.** When another creature within 30 feet of the drake that it can see hits a target with a weapon attack, the drake infuses the strike with its essence, causing the target to take an extra **1d6** damage of the type determined by its Draconic Essence.
