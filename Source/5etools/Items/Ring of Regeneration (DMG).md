# Ring of Regeneration

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you regain `1d6` hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `1d6 + 1` days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
