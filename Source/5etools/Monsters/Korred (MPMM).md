## Traits

**Stone Camouflage.** The korred has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The korred makes two Greatclub or Rock attacks.

**Greatclub.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage, or 19 (**3d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage if the korred is on the ground.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage, or 19 (**3d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage if the korred is on the ground.


## Bonus Actions

**Command Hair.** The korred has at least one 50-foot-long rope woven out of its hair. The korred commands one such rope within 30 feet of it to move up to 20 feet and entangle a Large or smaller creature that the korred can see. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become [[grappled]] by the rope (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]]. The korred can use a bonus action to release the target, which is also freed if the korred dies or becomes [[incapacitated]].

A rope of korred hair has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point at the start of each of the korred's turns while the rope has at least 1 hit point and the korred is alive. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
