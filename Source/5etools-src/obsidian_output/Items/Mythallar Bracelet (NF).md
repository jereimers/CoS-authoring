# Mythallar Bracelet

*Wondrous Item, Common*

Three small, crystal beads made from a decommissioned mythallar are strung on this leather bracelet. As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can pluck one bead from the bracelet to gain [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) checks for 1 minute.

A bead disappears immediately after it's plucked. Once all three beads have been plucked, the bracelet loses its magic.
