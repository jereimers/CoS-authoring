## Traits

**Immutable Form.** The colossus is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the colossus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The colossus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The colossus deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Towering Terror.** Any enemy outside the colossus that starts its turn within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] until the start of the enemy's next turn. If the enemy's saving throw is successful, it is immune to this colossus's Towering Terror for the next 24 hours.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The colossus makes three attacks—one with its slam and two with its eldritch turrets—and then uses Stomp.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h29 (**3d12 + 10**) bludgeoning damage, and the colossus can push the target up to 20 feet away from it.

**Eldritch Turret.** Ranged Spell Attack +18 to hit, range 300 ft., one target. @h18 (**4d8**) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is knocked [[prone]].

**Stomp.** The colossus stomps one of its feet at a point on the ground within 20 feet of it. Any creature in a 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on this point must succeed on a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw or take 33 (**6d10**) bludgeoning damage and fall [[prone]]. Until the colossus uses its Stomp again or moves, the creature is [[restrained]]. While [[restrained]] in this way, the creature (or another creature within 5 feet of it) can use its action to make a DC 26 Strength check. On a success, the creature relocates to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the colossus and is no longer [[restrained]].

Structures, as well as nonmagical objects that are neither being worn nor carried, take the same amount of damage if they are in the cylinder (no save).

**Incinerating Beam {@recharge 5}.** The colossus fires a beam of light in a 150-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw, taking 60 (**11d10**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this beam is disintegrated, leaving behind anything it was wearing or carrying.
