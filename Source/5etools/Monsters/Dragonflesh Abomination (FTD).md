## Traits

**Cloying Miasma.** The abomination is surrounded by a noxious stench. At the start of the abomination's turn, any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the abomination's next turn.

**Regeneration.** The abomination regains 10 hit points at the start of its turns if it has at least 1 hit point.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The abomination makes three attacks using Claw, Acidic Spit, or a combination of them. It can replace one of the attacks with a Tail attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) poison damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d12 + 4**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Acidic Spit.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d6**) acid damage.

**Acid Belch {@recharge 5}.** The abomination belches forth a cloud of acidic gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 (**8d6**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
