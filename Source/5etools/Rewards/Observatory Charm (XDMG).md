# Observatory Charm

*Charm*

You can use your Observatory to peer into the far corners of [[Wildspace|XDMG]] and the [[Astral Plane|XDMG]]. After spending a Long Rest in your Observatory, you gain a magical Charm (see "[[Supernatural Gifts|XDMG]]" in [[chapter 3|XDMG]]) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[Contact Other Plane|XPHB]] without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.
