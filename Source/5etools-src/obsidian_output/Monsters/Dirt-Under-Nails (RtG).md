## Traits

**Dark One's Own Luck (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** When the warlock makes an ability check or saving throw, it can add a `d10` to the roll. It can do this after the roll is made but before any of the roll's effects occur.

**Regeneration.** Dirt-Under-Nails regains 10 hit points at the start of his turn if he is in contact with the ground. If Dirt-Under-Nails takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Dirt-Under-Nails dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Shared Senses.** Dirt-Under-Nails can see and hear what any plant within 120 ft can see and hear. In addition, Dirt-Under- Nails can communicate telepathically with any plant within this range.

**Special Equipment (+2 Rod of the Pact Keeper).** While holding this [[+2 Rod of the Pact Keeper|]], Dirt-Under-Nails gains a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of his warlock spells (included in modifications, below). In addition, he can regain 1 warlock spell slot as an action while holding the rod. He can't use this property again until he finishes a long rest.

**Tree Stride.** Once on each of its turns, Dirt-Under-Nails can use 10 feet of his movement to step magically into one copse of mushrooms within 5 feet of him and emerge from a second copse of mushrooms within 60 feet of it, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second copse. Both copses of mushrooms must be Large or bigger. Dirt-Under-Nails doesn't need to be able to see the second copse to use this ability.


## Actions

**Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) fire damage.
