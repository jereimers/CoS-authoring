## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The phisarazu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The phisarazu can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Sense.** When in contact with a web, the phisarazu knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

**Web Walker.** The phisarazu ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The phisarazu makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Scintillating Spray if available.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) poison damage, and the target has the [[poisoned]] condition until the start of the phisarazu's next turn.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h22 (**4d8 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Scintillating Spray {@recharge 5}.** The phisarazu expels shimmering webs in a 60-foot cone. Creatures and objects in that area are outlined by the glittering webs for 1 minute, during which time they emit dim light for 10 feet and can't benefit from the [[invisible]] condition. Additionally, creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The phisarazu transforms into a crab, drider, or giant crab, or returns to its true form. Its game statistics, except for its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
