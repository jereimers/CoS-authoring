# Charm of the Key

*Charm*

As a bonus action, you can touch a nonmagical melee weapon and imbue it with magic for 1 hour. For the duration, the weapon deals an extra **1d8** force damage on a hit and deals double damage to objects and structures. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
