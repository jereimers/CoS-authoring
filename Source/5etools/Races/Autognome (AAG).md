# Autognome

**Size:** Small  
**Speed:** 30  

## Creature Type

You are a Construct.

## Armored Casing

You are encased in thin metal or some other durable material. While you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 13 + your Dexterity modifier.

## Built for Success

You can add a `d4` to one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you make, and you can do so after seeing the `d20` roll but before the effects of the roll are resolved. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Healing Machine

If the [[mending]] spell is cast on you, you can spend a Hit Die, roll it, and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

In addition, your creator designed you to benefit from several spells that preserve life but that normally don't affect Constructs: [[cure wounds]], [[healing word]], [[mass cure wounds]], [[mass healing word]], and [[spare the dying]].

## Mechanical Nature

You have resistance to poison damage and immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being [[paralyzed]] or [[poisoned]]. You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.

## Sentry's Rest

When you take a long rest, you spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, instead of sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but you remain conscious.

## Specialized Design

You gain two tool proficiencies of your choice, selected from the [[Player's Handbook|PHB]].
