# Survival Mantle

*Item, Unknown*

This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.

A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum) and has advantage on saving throws against harmful gases (such as those created by a [[cloudkill]] spell, a [[stinking cloud]] spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
