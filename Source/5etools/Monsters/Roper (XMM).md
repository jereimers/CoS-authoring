## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The roper makes two Tentacle attacks, uses Reel, and makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** m +7, reach 5 ft. @h17 (**3d8 + 4**) Piercing damage.

**Tentacle.** m +7, reach 60 ft. @hThe target has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 14) from one of six tentacles, and the target has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition until the grapple ends.

The tentacle can be damaged, freeing a creature it has [[Grappled|XPHB]] when destroyed (AC 20, HP 10, [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Poison and Psychic damage). Damaging the tentacle deals no damage to the roper, and a destroyed tentacle regrows at the start of the roper's next turn.

**Reel.** The roper pulls each creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by it up to 30 feet straight toward it.
