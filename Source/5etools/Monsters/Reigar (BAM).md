## Traits

**Glory.** The reigar's Armor Class includes its Charisma modifier.

**Hold Breath.** The reigar can hold its breath for 1 hour.

**Special Equipment.** The reigar wears a [[talarith|BAM]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The reigar makes two Trident attacks.

**Trident.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage, or 8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (**1d6**) force damage if the reigar is wearing its talarith.

**Chromatic Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +10 to hit, range 90 ft., one target. @h22 (**5d8**) damage of a type chosen by the reigar from the following list: cold, fire, lightning, or radiant.

**Summon Duplicate (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Using its talarith, the reigar summons a duplicate of itself. The duplicate obeys the reigar's commands and uses the reigar's statistics, except it is an unaligned Construct that doesn't have a talarith of its own. The duplicate takes its turn immediately after the reigar. It vanishes after 1 hour or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.
