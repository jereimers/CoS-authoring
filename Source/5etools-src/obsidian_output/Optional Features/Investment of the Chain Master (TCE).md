# Investment of the Chain Master

When you cast [[find familiar]], you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits:

- The familiar gains either a flying speed or a swimming speed (your choice) of 40 feet.
- As a bonus action, you can command the familiar to take the [[Attack]] action.
- The familiar's weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.
- If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.
- When the familiar takes damage, you can use your reaction to grant it resistance against that damage.
