## Traits

**Discern Lie.** The drow discerns when a creature in earshot speaks a lie in a language the drow knows.

**Fey Ancestry.** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drow makes three Death Lance attacks.

**Death Lance.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.


## Bonus Actions

**Spectral Dagger (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The drow conjures a floating, spectral dagger within 60 feet of itself. The drow can make a melee spell attack (+10 to hit) against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger. On a hit, the target takes 9 (**1d8 + 5**) force damage.

The dagger lasts for 1 minute. As a bonus action on later turns, the drow can move the dagger up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against one creature within 5 feet of the dagger.
