# Blasting Powder

*Item, None*

This volatile alchemical powder comes in a small pouch. When ignited by an open flame or a fuse, the powder explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding pouch must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d6** bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A character can bind multiple pouches of blasting powder together so they explode at the same time. Each additional pouch increases the damage by `1d6` (maximum of `10d6`) and the blast radius by 5 feet (maximum of 20 feet).
