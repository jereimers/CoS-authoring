# Mark of Making

You gain the following benefits.

## Artisan's Intuition

When you make an Intelligence ([[Arcana|XPHB]]) check or an ability check using [[Artisan's Tools|XPHB]], you can roll `1d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

## Spellsmith

You know the [[Mending|XPHB]] cantrip. You also always have the [[Magic Weapon|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this feat).

## Spells of the Mark

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic class feature, the spells on the Mark of Making Spells table are added to that feature's spell list.
