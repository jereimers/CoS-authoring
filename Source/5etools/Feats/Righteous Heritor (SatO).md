# Righteous Heritor

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You can channel cosmic forces of good to gain these benefits:

- **Soothe Pain:** When you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by `1d10` + your proficiency bonus. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
