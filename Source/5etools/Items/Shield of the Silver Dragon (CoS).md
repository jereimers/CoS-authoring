# Shield of the Silver Dragon

*Item, Rare*

While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

The shield is emblazoned with a stylized silver dragon that is the emblem of the Order of the Silver Dragon (see [[{@i Curse of Strahd]], chapter 7|CoS|7|The Order of the Silver Dragon}). The shield whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't [[incapacitated]].

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
