## Traits

**Flyby.** The angel doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Magic Resistance.** The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The angel makes two melee attacks. It also uses Battlefield Inspiration.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) slashing damage, or 8 (**1d10 + 3**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (**4d8**) radiant damage. If the target is within 5 feet of any of the angel's allies, the target takes an extra 2 (**1d4**) radiant damage.

**Battlefield Inspiration.** The angel chooses up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Until the end of the angel's next turn, each target can add a `d4` to its attack rolls and saving throws.
