## Traits

**Awakening of the Scion.** The cradle is a container for the [[scion of Memnor|BGG]]. When the cradle drops to 0 hit points, its body dissipates into cloud wisps. The scion instantly appears in the space the cradle occupied and uses the cradle's initiative count.

**Flyby.** The cradle doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Legendary Resistance (5/Day).** If the cradle fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The cradle has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The cradle deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cradle makes three Slam or Wind Javelin attacks in any combination.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h31 (**4d10 + 9**) bludgeoning damage plus 19 (**3d12**) thunder damage.

**Wind Javelin.** Ranged Weapon Attack +17 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h27 (**4d8 + 9**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Vortex {@recharge 5}.** The cradle conjures a vortex of wind at a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. The wind vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than the cradle in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 71 (**11d12**) bludgeoning damage and has the [[restrained]] condition within the vortex. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of the cradle's next turn. A creature with the [[restrained]] condition falls [[prone]] when the vortex ends.

A creature with the [[restrained]] condition can use its action to try to escape the vortex. The creature makes a DC 19 Strength ([[Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check. On a successful check, the creature escapes and moves `3d6 × 10` feet away from the vortex in a random direction.



## Reactions

**Thunderclap.** Immediately after taking damage, the cradle unleashes a thunderclap in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. All other creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (**4d8**) thunder damage and have the [[deafened]] condition for 1 minute.
