# Chain

*Item, None*

As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can wrap a Chain around an unwilling creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [[Grappled|XPHB]], [[Incapacitated|XPHB]], or [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until it escapes. Escaping the Chain requires the creature to make a successful DC 18 Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) check as an action. Bursting the Chain requires a successful DC 20 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check as an action.
