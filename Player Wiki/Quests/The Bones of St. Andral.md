# Objective

Find and return the Bones of St. Andral to the crypt beneath [[St. Andral's Church]]
# What the Party knows

- The church is ordinarily hallowed ground, as though the building was protected by a *hallow* spell. This magical ward prevents fiends and undead from entering the church, and keeps them from magically charming, frightening, or possessing those within it.
* The source of this protection is the crypt of Saint Andral, which has historically held the blessed bones of Andral himself, the founder of Vallaki's church and a great cleric of the Morninglord.
* Originally, only [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] knew of the bones' existence. However, after news the siege of Barovia reached Vallaki a few days ago, he shared the knowledge of the bones with [[Yeska]].
* To retain the church's protection, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] must invoke a particular rite of protection over Saint Andral's bones once every year, at dawn on the morning of Saint Andral's Feast—a holy day that memorializes Andral's life. 
* If the rite cannot be carried out at that time, the wards will fall until the rite is completed on a subsequent dawn. This year, the feast day falls on [[Neyavr 7]]
* Last night, someone broke into the church's crypt and stole St. Andral's bones, damaging the floorboards behind the altar and escaping through a window. Without the bones, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can't complete the protective rite, and the wards will fall at dawn on the day of St. Andral's Feast. 
* [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is fearful that some fell creature or wicked soul has manufactured this crisis as an opportunity to cause his congregation harm; though [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] is confident that no monsters could breach Vallaki's walls, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] fears that the town is not as safe as it appears.
