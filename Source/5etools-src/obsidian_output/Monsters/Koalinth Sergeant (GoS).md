## Traits

**Amphibious.** The koalinth can breathe air and water.

**Martial Advantage.** Once per turn, the sergeant can deal an extra 7 (**2d6**) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the sergeant that isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sergeant makes two melee attacks with its trident.

**Trident.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage, or 6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Hooked Net.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 10/30 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage, and the target is [[restrained]]. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check to free itself or another creature in a hooked net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) frees the target without harming it and destroys the net.



## Reactions

**Spear the Helpless (2/Day).** Whenever a creature within 30 feet of the sergeant becomes [[restrained]], the sergeant can move its speed toward the [[restrained]] creature. If the sergeant ends its move within reach of the [[restrained]] creature, it can make a melee attack against it.
