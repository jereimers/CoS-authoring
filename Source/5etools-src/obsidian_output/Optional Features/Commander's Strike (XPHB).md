# Commander's Strike

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a willing creature who can see or hear you and expend one Superiority Die. That creature can immediately use its [[Reaction|XPHB]] to make one attack with a weapon or an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]], adding the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll on a hit.
