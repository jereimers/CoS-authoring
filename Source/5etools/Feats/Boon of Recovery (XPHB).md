# Boon of Recovery

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Last Stand

When you would be reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], you can drop to 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] instead and regain a number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to half your [[Hit Points|XPHB]] maximum. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Recover Vitality

You have a pool of ten d10s. As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can expend dice from the pool, roll those dice, and regain a number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the roll's total. You regain all the expended dice when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
