## Traits

**Intellect Fortress.** The braxat's AC includes its Intelligence modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The braxat makes two Greatclub attacks.

**Greatclub.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.

**Acid Breath {@recharge}.** The braxat exhales a 15-foot cone of acid. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 26 (**4d12**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Psionic Shield (3/Day).** When the braxat would be hit by an attack roll or a [[magic missile]] spell that originates from a source the braxat can see, the braxat can create an [[invisible]] barrier of magical force around itself that lasts until the start of its next turn. This barrier gives the braxat a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and prevents [[magic missile]] spells from damaging it.
