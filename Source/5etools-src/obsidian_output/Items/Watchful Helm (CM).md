# Watchful Helm

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While you wear this helm, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and remain aware of your surroundings even while you're asleep, and you have advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

As a bonus action, you can cast the [[see invisibility]] spell from the helm. Once this property of the helm is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
