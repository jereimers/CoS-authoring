## Actions

**Multiattack.** The war priest makes two Maul attacks, and it uses Holy Fire.

**Maul.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage  plus @h10 (**3d6**) radiant damage.

**Holy Fire.** The war priest targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 12 (**2d8 + 3**) radiant damage, and it is [[blinded]] until the start of the war priest's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't [[blinded]].


## Bonus Actions

**Healing Light {@recharge 4}.** The war priest or one creature of its choice within 60 feet of it regains 12 (`2d8 + 3`) hit points.
