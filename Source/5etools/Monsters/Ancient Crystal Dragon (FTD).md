## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h18 (**2d10 + 7**) piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) radiant damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d6 + 7**) slashing damage.

**Scintillating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a burst of brilliant radiance in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 49 (**11d8**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The dragon then gains 25 temporary hit points by absorbing a portion of the radiant energy.


## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The dragon magically transforms into any creature that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.

**Psychic Step.** The dragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Claw.** The dragon makes one Claw attack.

**Psionics (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon uses Psychic Step or Spellcasting.

**Starlight Strike (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon releases a searing beam of starlight at a creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 38 (**11d6**) radiant damage.
