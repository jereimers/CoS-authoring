## Traits

**Two-Headed.** The dog has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks and on saving throws against being [[blinded]], [[charmed]], [[deafened]], [[frightened]], [[stunned]], or knocked [[unconscious]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dog makes two bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [[poisoned]] until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (`1d10`) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
