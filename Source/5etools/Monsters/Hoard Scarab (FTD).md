## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the scarab is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the scarab move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the scarab is animate.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Scale Dust (1/Day).** The scarab releases magical glittering dust from its wings. Each creature within 5 feet of the scarab must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in blue light for 10 minutes. While outlined in this way, a creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from being [[invisible]]. In addition, every Dragon within 1 mile of the creature becomes aware of it and can unerringly track the creature. Casting [[dispel magic]] on the creature ends the effect on it.
