# Mythallar Cloak

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This electric-blue cloak is studded with sewn-in crystals that are shards of a decommissioned mythallar. The cloak has 10 charges and regains `1d10` expended charges daily at dawn.

While wearing the cloak, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] and expend 1 charge to activate the cloak's magic. The magic lasts for 1 minute or until you end it early (no action required).

While the cloak's magic is active, you gain a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] of 30 feet and can hover. Additionally, once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll and deal damage, you can cause the target to take an extra **1d4** Radiant damage. If you are aloft when the cloak's magic ends, you fall.
