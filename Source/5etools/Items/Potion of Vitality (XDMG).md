# Potion of Vitality

*Item, Very Rare*

When you drink this potion, it removes any [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] levels you have and ends the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition on you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the maximum number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] for any [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]] you spend.

This potion's crimson liquid regularly pulses with dull light, calling to mind a heartbeat.
