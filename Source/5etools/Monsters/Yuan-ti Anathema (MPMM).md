## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The anathema has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Ophidiophobia Aura.** Any creature of the anathema's choice, other than a snake or a yuan-ti, that starts its turn within 30 feet of the anathema must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] of snakes and yuan-ti. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this anathema's aura for the next 24 hours.

**Six Heads.** The anathema has advantage on saves against being [[blinded]], [[charmed]], [[deafened]], [[frightened]], [[stunned]], or knocked [[unconscious]].


## Actions

**Multiattack (Anathema Form Only).** The anathema makes two Claw attacks and one Flurry of Bites attack.

**Claw (Anathema Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Flurry of Bites (Anathema Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h27 (**6d6 + 6**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) poison damage.

**Constrict (Snake Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one Large or smaller creature. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (**2d6**) acid damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and it takes 16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (**2d6**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The anathema can constrict only one creature at a time.


## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The anathema transforms into a Huge constrictor snake or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
