## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The ceremorph has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The ceremorph makes one Slam attack and one Tentacles attack. The ceremorph can replace one of the attacks with a Mind Bolt attack, if available.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h22 (**4d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) psychic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until this grapple ends.

**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [[incapacitated]] Humanoid [[grappled]] by the ceremorph. @h55 (**10d10**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the ceremorph kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Bolt (3/Day).** Ranged Spell Attack +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h17 (**2d12 + 4**) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the end of its next turn.
