# Wand of Polymorph

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the [[polymorph]] spell (save DC 15) from it.

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
