## Traits

**Lightning Overload.** When the robot takes lightning damage, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the start of its next turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The robot makes two Tentacle attacks or three Laser Beam attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16). While [[grappled]], the target also has the [[restrained]] condition. The robot has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Laser Beam.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h16 (**4d6 + 2**) radiant damage.

**Grenade Launcher {@recharge 5}.** The robot fires a grenade at a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. The grenade explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point, creating one of the following effects (robot's choice):

**Concussion Grenade.** Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (**6d6**) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Sleep Grenade.** Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[unconscious]] condition for 1 hour. The condition ends on a creature early if the creature takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.


## Bonus Actions

**Emergency Speed (2/Day).** The robot takes the Dash or Disengage action.
