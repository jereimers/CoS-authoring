## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the amnizu's [[darkvision]].

**Magic Resistance.** The amnizu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The amnizu uses Blinding Rot or Forgetfulness, if available. It also makes two Taskmaster Whip attacks.

**Taskmaster Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) slashing damage plus 16 (**3d10**) force damage.

**Blinding Rot.** The amnizu targets one or two creatures that it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (**4d12**) necrotic damage and be [[blinded]] until the start of the amnizu's next turn.

**Forgetfulness {@recharge}.** The amnizu targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. That creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw or take 26 (**4d12**) psychic damage and become [[stunned]] for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target is [[stunned]] for the full minute, it forgets everything it sensed, experienced, and learned during the last 5 hours.



## Reactions

**Instinctive Charm.** When a creature within 60 feet of the amnizu makes an attack roll against it, and another creature is within the attack's range, the attacker must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature that is closest to it, not including the amnizu or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. If the saving throw is successful, the attacker is immune to the amnizu's Instinctive Charm for 24 hours.
