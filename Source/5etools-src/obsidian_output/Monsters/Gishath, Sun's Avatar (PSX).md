## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Gishath fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Gishath makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stomp or tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h39 (**5d12 + 7**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and Gishath can't bite another target.

**Swallow.** Gishath makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside Gishath, and it takes 21 (**6d6**) acid damage at the start of each of Gishath's turns.

If Gishath takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of it. If Gishath dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Stomp.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h29 (**5d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h25 (**4d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** Gishath makes one stomp or tail attack.

**Roar (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature that is within 120 feet of Gishath and can hear it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Gishath's Roar for the next 24 hours.
