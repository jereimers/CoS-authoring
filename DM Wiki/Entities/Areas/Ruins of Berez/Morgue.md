# S24. Morgue

A raven perches on the windowsill of this otherwise empty room.

If the characters approach the raven, it flies to the shoulder of the nearest scarecrow in the garden (area S9).
A character who kills the raven is cursed. While cursed, the character has disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks. A greater restoration spell, a remove curse spell, or a similar effect ends the curse.
