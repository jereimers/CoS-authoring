# Toll the Dead

*Cantrip necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the single chime of a dolorous bell is audible within 10 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take **1d8** Necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it instead takes **1d12** Necrotic damage.

## Cantrip Upgrade

The damage increases by one die when you reach levels 5 (**2d8** or **2d12**), 11 (**3d8** or **3d12**), and 17 (**4d8** or **4d12**).
