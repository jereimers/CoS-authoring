## Traits

**Creature Sense.** The neothelid is aware of the presence of creatures within 1 mile of it that have an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. It knows the distance and direction to each creature, as well as each creature's Intelligence score, but can't sense anything else about it. A creature protected by a [[mind blank]] spell, a [[nondetection]] spell, or similar magic can't be perceived in this manner.

**Magic Resistance.** The neothelid has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (**3d8**) psychic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the neothelid. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the neothelid, and it takes 35 (**10d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the neothelid's turns.

If the neothelid takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the neothelid must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the neothelid. If the neothelid dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Acid Breath {@recharge 5}.** The neothelid exhales acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (**10d6**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
