# Talking Doll

*Wondrous Item, Common* *(requires attunement)*

While this doll is within 5 feet of you, you can spend a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] telling it to say up to six phrases, none of which can be more than six words long, and set a condition under which the doll speaks each phrase. You can also replace old phrases with new ones. Whatever the condition, it must occur within 5 feet of the doll to make it speak. For example, whenever someone picks up the doll, it might say, "I want a piece of candy." The doll's phrases are lost when your [[Attunement|XPHB]] to the doll ends.
