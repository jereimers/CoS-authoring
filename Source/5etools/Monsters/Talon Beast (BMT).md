## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The talon beast has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sense Magic.** The talon beast can detect and pinpoint the location of magic within 120 feet of itself.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The talon beast makes two Talon attacks or a Talon attack and a Beak attack.

**Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage, and if the target has any spell effects on itself or any magic items in its possession, the target must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a random spell effect on the target ends. If the target has no spell effects on it, one random magic item in its possession has its magical properties suppressed for 1 minute. If the item is a potion or scroll, it becomes nonmagical instead.

**Talon.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) slashing damage, and the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 17). Until the grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition, and the talon beast can't use Talon on another target.
