## Traits

**Charge.** If the unicorn moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (**2d8**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Magic Resistance.** The unicorn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The unicorn's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The unicorn makes two attacks: one with its hooves and one with its horn.

**Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.

**Horn.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Healing Touch (3/Day).** The unicorn touches another creature with its horn. The target magically regains 11 (`2d8 + 2`) hit points. In addition, the touch removes all diseases and neutralizes all poisons afflicting the target.

**Teleport (1/Day).** The unicorn magically teleports itself and up to three willing creatures it can see within 5 feet of it, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a location the unicorn is familiar with, up to 1 mile away.
