Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's [[Speed|XPHB]] is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to [[Armor Class|XPHB]], it has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the [[Attack|XPHB]] (one attack only), [[Dash|XPHB]], [[Disengage|XPHB]], [[Hide|XPHB]], or [[Utilize|XPHB]] action.

When the spell ends, the target is [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] and has a [[Speed|XPHB]] of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.
