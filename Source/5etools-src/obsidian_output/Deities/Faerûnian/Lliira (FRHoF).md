# Lliira

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Lliira is ever-changing, constantly moving, vibrantly alive. She embodies joy, contentment, dance, and freedom, and is beloved by many. As the patron of festivals, she is honored at celebrations and primarily worshiped in dance.

Artists depict Lliira as a woman soaring through the sky in elated dance. She manifests on the Material Plane as a cluster of brightly whirling lights, a single light that leaves a glittering trail, or peals of joyous laughter. [[Will-o'-Wisp|XMM]] and the [[Dancing Lights|XPHB]] spell are easily mistaken as signs of her presence to the untrained eye, and necromancers and charlatans take advantage of these similarities to fool unwitting victims. Joyful **Empyrean Iotas** or dancing pixies are Lliira's messengers of choice. Lliira is especially popular with satyrs. Several of the songs, dances, and prayers associated with her can be traced back to communities of these fun-loving fey.

Dancers and hedonists are among the Lliira's most devoted worshipers. Some of her followers train in bardic techniques of the College of Dance to better express their devotion. Her followers wear at least one item of clothing in a bright, cheerful color. They aren't frivolous, however. To them, divine joy is a greatly needed gift to the world of mortals.

Lliira's priests, known as joybringers, spread joy wherever possible. They throw excellent parties and are among the most beloved clergy in Faerûn. Joybringers' vestments more resemble festival attire than somber ecclesiastical garments. Joybringers are folk of whimsy and light spirits, prone to jokes but never pranks. Fighting or drawing weapons (except in ceremony) is strictly forbidden at joybringer celebrations.

Lliira's Chosen fight those who bring misery to others. These Chosen master mirthful spells such as [[Tasha's Hideous Laughter|XPHB]] and [[Otto's Irresistible Dance|XPHB]], wielding them against evil forces like sharpened weapons. They battle fiercely against their foes and joyously revel when their work is done.
