## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Sammaster fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Life Suppression.** Creatures within 60 feet of Sammaster can't regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]].

**Magic Resistance.** Sammaster has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Soul Gem.** If Sammaster is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] while his magical soul gem exists, his lich form dissolves to dust. After `1d10` days, he appears in the space of his soul gem, using the Sammaster (Dracolich Form) stat block. The gem is a Tiny object that has AC 20; HP 50; and [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Acid, Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage. The gem regains all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] at the end of every turn, but it turns to dust if reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. If the gem is destroyed, Sammaster can create a new one by completing an 8-hour ritual using a gem worth 1,000+ GP, which the ritual consumes, and by expending 5,000 GP.
