## Traits

**Blaze Rod.** When the blaze drops to 0 hit points, it disappears in a cloud of smoke and has a 50 percent chance of leaving behind a glowing rod worth 100 gp. The rod sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. As an action, a creature can try to snap the rod, doing so with a successful DC 14 Strength check. The snapped rod releases its fiery energy in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6 (**1d12**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Heat Aura.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the blaze takes 3 (**1d6**) fire damage.

**Illumination.** The blaze sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**Water Susceptibility.** The blaze takes 1 cold damage for every 5 feet it moves in water, for every gallon of water splashed on it, or whenever it starts its turn in the rain.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The blaze makes three Fiery Doom attacks.

**Fiery Doom.** Attack (ms,rs) +6 to hit; reach 5 ft. or ranged 60 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) fire damage, and the target catches fire if it's a creature or a flammable object. Until a creature takes an action to extinguish the fire, the burning target takes 3 (**1d6**) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.
