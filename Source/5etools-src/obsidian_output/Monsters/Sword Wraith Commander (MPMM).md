## Traits

**Turning Defiance.** The commander and any other sword wraiths within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn Undead.

**Unusual Nature.** The commander doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The commander makes two Longsword or Longbow attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Call to Honor (1/Day).** If the commander has taken damage during this combat, it gives itself advantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn, and `1d4 + 1` [[sword wraith warrior|MPMM]] appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of it. The warriors last until they drop to 0 hit points, and they take their turns immediately after the commander's turn on the same initiative count.


## Bonus Actions

**Martial Fury.** The commander makes one Longsword or Longbow attack, which deals an extra 9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage on a hit, and attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.
