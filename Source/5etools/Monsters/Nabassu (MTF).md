## Traits

**Demonic Shadows.** The nabassu darkens the area around its body in a 10-foot radius. Nonmagical light can't illuminate this area of dim light.

**Devour Soul.** A nabassu can eat the soul of a creature it has killed within the last hour, provided that creature is neither a construct nor an undead. The devouring requires the nabassu to be within 5 feet of the corpse for at least 10 minutes, after which it gains a number of Hit Dice (`d8`s) equal to half the creature's number of Hit Dice. Roll those dice, and increase the nabassu's hit points by the numbers rolled. For every 4 Hit Dice the nabassu gains in this way, its attacks deal an extra 3 (**1d6**) damage on a hit. The nabassu retains these benefits for 6 days. A creature devoured by a nabassu can be restored to life only by a [[wish]] spell.

**Magic Resistance.** The nabassu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The nabassu's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nabassu uses its Soul-Stealing Gaze and makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its bite.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h32 (**4d12 + 6**) piercing damage.

**Soul-Stealing Gaze.** The nabassu targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the nabassu and isn't a construct or an undead, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or reduce its hit point maximum by 13 (**2d12**) damage and give the nabassu an equal number of temporary hit points. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0, and if the target is a humanoid, it immediately rises as a [[ghoul]] under the nabassu's control.
