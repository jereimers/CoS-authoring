# Description

These pastries look and smell like mincemeat pies. Peddled by that perfectly sweet old lady [[Morgantha]], the pastries send their consumer into an hours-long trance upon ingestion. While in the trance, the consumer dreams of being in some joyous place, far removed from the evils of the world. The places and characters in the dream are vivid and believable, and when the dream ends, the affected consumer experiences a longing to return to the place.

- [[Varnish Gothorn|Varnish]] ate one of these very early on. Did he experience joy and bliss?
