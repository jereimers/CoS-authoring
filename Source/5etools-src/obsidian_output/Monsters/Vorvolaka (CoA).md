## Traits

**Fear Aura.** Any hostile creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the vorvolaka must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or have [[frightened]] condition until the start of the creature's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, they're immune to the vorvolaka's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours. This ability does not function if the vorvolaka is [[unconscious]].

**Magic Resistance.** The vorvolaka has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Regeneration.** The vorvolaka regains 15 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the vorvolaka takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vorvolaka's next turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The vorvolaka makes two Talon attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with Rend Armor (if available).

**Talon.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h22 (**4d8 + 4**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage.

**Rend Armor {@recharge 4}.** The vorvolaka makes a Talon attack against a creature. On a hit, the creature's AC is reduced by 2 for 1 minute. Creatures not wearing armor are immune to this effect, and the total reduction can't bring a creature below an AC of 10.
