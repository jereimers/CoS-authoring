## Traits

**Corruption.** As a bonus action, the nagpa targets one creature it can see within 90 feet of it. The target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. An evil creature makes the save with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target is [[charmed]] by the nagpa until the start of the nagpa's next turn. On a successful save, the target becomes immune to the nagpa's Corruption for the next 24 hours.

**Paralysis {@recharge}.** As a bonus action, the nagpa forces each creature within 30 feet of it to succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. A [[paralyzed]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Undead and constructs are immune to this effect.


## Actions

**Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.
