## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Soth fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Soth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Marshal Undead.** Unless Soth is [[incapacitated]], he and Undead creatures of his choice within 60 feet of him are immune to features that turn Undead.

**Unusual Nature.** Soth doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Soth makes three Forsaken Brand attacks.

**Forsaken Brand.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (**4d8**) necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of Soth's next turn.

**Cataclysmic Fire (1/Day).** Soth hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point he can see within 120 feet of himself. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 35 (**10d6**) fire damage and 35 (**10d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Additionally, any Medium or smaller Humanoid killed by this damage, as well as every corpse of such a creature within the sphere, becomes a skeleton (see the Monster Manual) under Soth's control. The skeleton acts on Soth's initiative but immediately after his turn. Absent any other command, the skeleton tries to kill any non-Undead creature it encounters.

**Word of Death (1/Day).** Soth points at a creature he can see within 60 feet of himself and magically commands it to die. The target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target dies.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Implacable Maneuver.** Soth moves up to his speed or commands a mount he is riding to move up to its speed. The movement from this action doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. If he or his mount moves within 5 feet of a creature during this movement, he can force the creature to make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. The creature is knocked [[prone]] unless it succeeds on the saving throw.

**Strike (Costs 2 Actions).** Soth makes one Forsaken Brand attack.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** Soth uses Spellcasting.
