# Khoravar

**Size:** Small, Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Darkvision

You have [[Darkvision|XPHB]] with a range of 60 feet.

## Fey Ancestry

You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition.

## Fey Gift

You know the [[Friends|XPHB]] cantrip. Whenever you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you can replace that cantrip with a different cantrip from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it (choose the ability when you select this species).

## Lethargy Resilience

When you fail a saving throw to avoid or end the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition, you can succeed instead. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish `1d4` [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Skill Versatility

You gain proficiency in one skill or with one tool of your choice. Whenever you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you can replace it with another skill or tool proficiency.
