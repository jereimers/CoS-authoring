## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h2 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) force damage.



## Reactions

**Magic Allergy (1/Day).** Immediately after a creature within 30 feet of the gremishka casts a spell, the gremishka can spontaneously react to the magic. Roll a `d6` to determine the effect:

- **1-2:** The gremishka emanates magical energy. Each creature within 30 feet of the gremishka must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (**1d6**) force damage.
- **3-4:** The gremishka surges with magical energy and regains 3 (`1d6`) hit points.
- **5-6:** The gremishka explodes and dies, and one swarm of gremishkas instantly appears in the space where this gremishka died. The swarm uses the gremishka's initiative.
