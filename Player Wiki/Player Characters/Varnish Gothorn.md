**Appearance:** A 4-foot-tall dwarf with pale skin and no hair. Their eyes are always hidden behind sunglasses—no one knows what lies beneath. They carry themselves with the confidence of someone who has operated in the shadows.

**Key Abilities:** A knowledgeable bard with a silver tongue and criminal connections. Proficient with thieves' tools and musical instruments (clarinet, dulcimer, pan flute). Their dwarven heritage grants them superior darkvision (120 ft.) and poison resistance. As a lore bard, they can use Cutting Words to disrupt enemies and possess broad knowledge through Jack of All Trades.

# Backstory (public)

Varnish serves a vampire lord—their one true faith. Their criminal past has given them skills in deception, stealth, and sleight of hand, making them an invaluable asset for covert operations. Despite their lawful evil alignment, they work alongside the party, though their ultimate loyalties remain an open question.

# Personality & Beliefs

*Varnish keeps their personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws close to their chest—much like whatever lies behind those ever-present sunglasses.*
