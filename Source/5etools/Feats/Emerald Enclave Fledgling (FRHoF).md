# Emerald Enclave Fledgling

You gain the following benefits.

## Speak with Animals

You always have the [[Speak with Animals|XPHB]] spell prepared and can cast it with any spell slots you have. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat). When you cast this spell as a [[Ritual|XPHB]], its duration is 8 hours.

## Tag Team

When you take the [[Help|XPHB]] action, you can switch places with a willing ally within 5 feet of yourself as part of that same action. This movement doesn't provoke [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]]. You can't use this benefit if the ally has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.
