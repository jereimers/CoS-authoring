# Wild Magic Zone

A past magical disaster or uncontrolled surge of power in a particular place can cause the fabric of magic to unravel, creating a wild magic zone. In such an area, which is typically no more than 300 feet in diameter, magic behaves unpredictably.

Whenever a creature expends a spell slot to cast a spell in a wild magic zone, roll `1d20`. If you roll a 20 on the die, roll on the [[Wild Magic Surge|XPHB]] table in the [[Player's Handbook|XPHB]] to create a magical effect.
