# War Caster

**Prerequisites:** Spellcasting ability

You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your [[concentration]] on a spell when you take damage.
- You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a [[shield|phb]] in one or both hands.
- When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.
