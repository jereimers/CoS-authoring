## Traits

**Blood Frenzy.** The deep diver has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

**Brine Lurker.** The deep diver has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made while submerged in water.

**Limited Amphibiousness.** The deep diver can breathe air and water, but it needs to be submerged at least once every 4 hours to avoid suffocating.

**Lure.** The deep diver can cause its lure to light up or darken at will. While the lure is lit, the deep diver sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius centered on itself and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**Shark Telepathy.** The deep diver can magically command any shark within 120 feet of it, using a limited telepathy.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The deep diver makes two attacks with its glaive, or one attack with its bite and two with its claws.

**Glaive.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d10 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Light of Sekolah.** The deep diver pulses magical light from its lure. Any creature within 30 feet of the deep diver that can see the light must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be [[charmed]] until the end of its next turn. A creature [[charmed]] in this way is [[incapacitated]] as it stares at the light.
