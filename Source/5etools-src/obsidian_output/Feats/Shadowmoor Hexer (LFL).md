# Shadowmoor Hexer

You gain the following benefits.

## Hex

You always have the [[Hex|XPHB]] spell prepared. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat). You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

## Curse Magic

When a creature that you've cursed with [[Hex|XPHB]] hits you with an attack roll, the creature takes Psychic damage equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.
