## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny neogi hatchling. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Swarm of Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h22 (**6d6 + 1**) poison damage, or 11 (**3d6 + 1**) poison damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
