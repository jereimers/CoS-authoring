# Webs

Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled areas are [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]].

A creature that enters a web-filled area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition. As an action, a creature Restrained by the webs can try to escape from them, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) check.

Each 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of webs has AC 10; HP 15; Vulnerability to Fire damage; and Immunity to Piercing, Poison, and Psychic damage.
