## Traits

**Cunning Opportunist.** The stone cursed has advantage on the attack rolls of opportunity attacks.

**False Appearance.** While the stone cursed remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue.


## Actions

**Petrifying Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) slashing damage, or 14 (**2d10 + 3**) slashing damage if the attack roll had advantage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and is [[restrained]] until the end of its next turn, when it must repeat the saving throw. The effect ends if the second save is successful; otherwise the target is [[petrified]] for 24 hours.
