# Lock of Trickery

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This lock appears to be an ordinary [[Lock|XPHB]] (of the type described in chapter 6 of the [[Player's Handbook|XPHB]]) and comes with a single key. The tumblers in this lock magically adjust to thwart burglars. Dexterity checks made to pick the lock have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]].
