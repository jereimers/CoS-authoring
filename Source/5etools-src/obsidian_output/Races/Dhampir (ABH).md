# Dhampir

**Size:** Small, Medium  
**Speed:** walk 35 ft., climb (equal to walking)  

## Darkvision

You have [[Darkvision|XPHB]] with a range of 60 feet.

## Spider Climb

You have a [[Climb Speed|XPHB]] equal to your [[Speed|XPHB]]. When you reach character level 3, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings while leaving your hands free.

## Trace of Undeath

You have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Necrotic damage.

## Vampiric Bite

When you use your [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]] and deal damage, you can choose to bite with your fangs. You deal Piercing damage equal to `1d4` plus your Constitution modifier instead of the normal damage of an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]].

In addition, when you deal this damage to a creature that isn't a Construct or an Undead, you can empower yourself in one of the following ways:

- **Drain:** You regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the Piercing damage dealt.
- **Strengthen:** You gain a bonus to the next ability check or attack roll you make within the next minute; the bonus is equal to the Piercing damage dealt.

You can empower yourself with this trait a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
