## Traits

**Guardian of the Market.** Pazrodine can sense when an item is stolen from Seelie Market. She knows the distance and direction to stolen items, as if by the [[Locate Object]] spell.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Pazrodine fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Pazrodine makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) radiant damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Breath Weapon {@recharge 5}.** Pazrodine uses one of the following breath weapons:

- **Dream Breath:** Pazrodine exhales mist in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or have the [[unconscious]] condition for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
- **Moonlight Breath:** Pazrodine exhales a beam of moonlight in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 60 (**11d10**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
