## Traits

**Dazzling Visage.** A brilliant array of chromatic colors emanates from Windfall, causing attack rolls against her to have disadvantage. This trait ceases to function while Windfall has the [[incapacitated]] condition or has a speed of 0.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Windfall fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Special Equipment.** Windfall wears an iridescent magic coat that was tailored specifically for her and imbued with Tiamat's power. When she dies, the coat functions as a [[Robe of Scintillating Colors]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Windfall makes two Chromatic Rapier attacks and uses Dragon's Fury once.

**Chromatic Rapier.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d8 + 7**) piercing damage plus 21 (**6d6**) acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (Windfall's choice).

**Dragon's Fury.** Windfall targets one creature she can see within 60 feet of herself and unleashes a burst of magical ire. The target must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 36 (**8d8**) psychic damage and has the [[frightened]] condition until the start of Windfall's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.


## Bonus Actions

**Stunning Scintillation {@recharge 5}.** Windfall emits an overwhelming array of colors from her coat. Each creature within 30 feet of Windfall that can see her must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the start of Windfall's next turn.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Deft Dance.** Windfall moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Dragon's Flare.** Windfall flares with multicolored flames and targets a creature she can see within 30 feet of herself. The target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 26 (**4d12**) damage of a type chosen by Windfall: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Windfall uses Spellcasting.
