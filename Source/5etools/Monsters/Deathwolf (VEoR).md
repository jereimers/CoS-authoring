## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If the deathwolf fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Moon's Grace.** When the deathwolf falls, it descends at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes no falling damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The deathwolf makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Phantom Deathwolf if available.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on saving throws against the [[frightened]] condition. This curse lasts until removed by the [[Remove Curse]] spell or other magic.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) necrotic damage.

**Phantom Deathwolf {@recharge 5}.** The deathwolf creates a terrifying phantom of itself in the mind of a creature the deathwolf can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[frightened]] condition for 1 minute.

While the target is [[frightened]], the phantom deals 21 (**6d6**) psychic damage to the target at the start of each of the target's turns. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



## Reactions

**Imposing Slash.** When a creature within 5 feet of the deathwolf makes an attack roll against it, the deathwolf forces the creature to succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on that roll. After the attack hits or misses, the deathwolf makes one Claw attack against the creature.

**Phase Step.** Immediately after taking damage, the deathwolf teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see that is in dim light or darkness.
