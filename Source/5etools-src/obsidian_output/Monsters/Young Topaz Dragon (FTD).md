## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe both air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 28 (**8d6**) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.
