*4th-level illusion*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusion of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes **4d10** Psychic damage and has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on ability checks and attack rolls for the duration. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and the spell ends.

For the duration, the target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes the Psychic damage again. On a successful save, the spell ends.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `4d10` for each spell slot level above 4.
