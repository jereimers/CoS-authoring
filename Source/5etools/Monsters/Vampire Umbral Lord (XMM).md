**Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).** If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Shadow Escape.** If the vampire drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] outside its resting place, it teleports into its resting place unless it is in running water or sunlight. If it can't teleport, it is destroyed. Once inside its resting place, it has the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition for 1 hour, after which it regains 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].

- **Forbiddance:** The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from an occupant.
- **Running Water:** The vampire takes 20 Acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
- **Stake to the Heart:** If a weapon that deals Piercing damage is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition in its resting place, the vampire has the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition until the weapon is removed.
- **Sunlight:** The vampire takes 20 Radiant damage if it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls and ability checks.
