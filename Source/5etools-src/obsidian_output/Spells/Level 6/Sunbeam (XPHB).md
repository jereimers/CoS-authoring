**Range:** Self (60-feet line)  
**Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature in the [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **6d8** Radiant damage and has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to create a new [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of radiance.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
