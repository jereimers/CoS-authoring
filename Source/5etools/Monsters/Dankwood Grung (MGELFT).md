## Traits

**Amphibious.** The grung can breathe air and water.

**Poisonous Skin.** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A [[poisoned]] creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Standing Leap.** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.


## Actions

**Grumpy Grung Growl.** A ferocious gurgling issues from the throat of the Dankwood grung, warning those within 15 feet that they are indeed grumpy. Creatures in that area must succeed at a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be [[frightened]] until the end of their next turn.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +0 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) piercing damage in melee, or 3 (**1d4 + 1**) piercing damage at range. Target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (**2d4**) poison damage.
