## Traits

**Legendary Resistances (3/Day).** If the hertilod fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The hertilod has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Shock Susceptibility.** If the hertilod takes lightning damage, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or immediately regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which lands in a space within 10 feet of the hertilod and has the [[prone]] condition.

**Spider Climb.** The hertilod can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hertilod makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) piercing damage plus 13 (**2d12**) poison damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the hertilod. A swallowed creature has the [[blinded]] and [[restrained]] conditions, and it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the hertilod. At the start of each of the hertilod's turns, each swallowed creature takes 13 (**2d12**) poison damage from the poisonous secretion in the hertilod's gullet.

The hertilod's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the hertilod takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the hertilod must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which lands in a space within 10 feet of the hertilod and has the [[prone]] condition. If the hertilod dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting with the [[prone]] condition.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) slashing damage.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Sprint.** The hertilod moves up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Feed (Costs 2 Actions).** The hertilod drains life from the creatures in its gullet to bolster itself. Each creature in the hertilod's gullet takes 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage, and the hertilod regains a number of hit points equal to the damage.
