# Call Lightning

*3rd-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius.

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d10** Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one.

If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by **1d10**.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d10` for each spell slot level above 3.
