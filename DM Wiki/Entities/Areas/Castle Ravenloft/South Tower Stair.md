# K21. South Tower Stair

<div class="description"><p>Fluttering torches in iron sconces illuminate this spiral staircase. A chill wind rushes down the circling stairway, seeming to kill the very heat of the torches.</p></div>

These stairs start at area K73 and go up through areas K61, K9, K30, and K35 before ending at area K47.
