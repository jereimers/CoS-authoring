# Lightbringer

*Item, Uncommon*

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This weapon, known as Lightbringer, was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and is made of solid brass. The mace glows as bright as a torch when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra **1d6** radiant damage to Undead creatures.
