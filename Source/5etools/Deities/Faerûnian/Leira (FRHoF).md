# Leira

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Rogues, con artists, illusionist mages, and actors hold Leira in high regard, though none can identify specifics about the god or her intentions. She is an enigmatic deity of illusions, disguises, and deception.

Shortly after the Time of Troubles, Cyric slew Leira and became the god of lies in her stead. On her return, Leira reclaimed most of her portfolio, but not all of it. The folk of Faerûn now attribute everyday dishonesty to Leira, categorizing particularly heinous deception as the work of Cyric—though the boundary between such types of falsehood is rarely clear cut. Leira isn't viewed as malicious or a trickster, but instead as a mysterious recluse. She seldom communicates with her followers or manifests on the Material Plane. Nevertheless, [[Displacer Beast|XMM]] are sometimes seen as omens of her will, especially when encountered in places beyond the ordinary reach of fey influence.

Some folk perform a swirling motion with a finger behind their backs when telling a lie as a way of beseeching Leira for aid.Her faithful keep their secrets close and refrain from telling the truth when falsehoods or half-truths would serve them better. Only among fellow worshipers of Leira do they feel comfortable enough to speak plainly.

No images or statues of Leira grace her temples, since her priests know it is useless to presume the true appearance of a god of illusion. Her temples are disguised as other sites, marked with signs that only the faithful recognize. Leira's temples are filled with a white mist that normally remains low but can rise to fill the room and thicken to obscure vision if the temple's high priest desires. Her priests wear vestments of white and mist gray, and their faces are covered by smooth, featureless masks. They are loath to reveal their faces to the unfaithful and sometimes wield sleep-inducing poisons.

Leira's Chosen can alter their appearance at will. Little else is known about them, which is how they like it.
