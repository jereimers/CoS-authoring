**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [[incapacitated]] humanoid [[grappled]] by the mind flayer. @hThe target takes 55 (**10d10**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (**4d8 + 4**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute.
