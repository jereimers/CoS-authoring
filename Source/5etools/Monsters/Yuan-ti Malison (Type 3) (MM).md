**Magic Resistance.** The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Malison Type.** The yuan-ti has one of the following types:

- **Type 1::** Human body with snake head
- **Type 2::** Human head and body with snakes for arms
- **Type 3::** Human head and upper body with a serpentine lower body instead of legs
