# Scion of the Outer Planes

Your connection to an Outer Plane infuses you with the energy there. Choose a type of plane listed in the Planar Infusion table. Your choice gives you resistance to a damage type and the ability to cast a cantrip, as specified in the table. You can cast this cantrip without material components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).

| Plane | Damage Resistance | Cantrip |
|---|---|---|
| Chaotic Outer Plane | Poison | [[Minor illusion]] |
| Evil Outer Plane | Necrotic | [[Chill touch]] |
| Good Outer Plane | Radiant | [[Sacred flame]] |
| Lawful Outer Plane | Force | [[Guidance]] |
| The Outlands | Psychic | [[Mage hand]] |
