## Traits

**Divine Being.** Auril can't be [[surprised]] and can't be changed into another form against her will.

**Divine Rejuvenation.** When Auril drops to 0 hit points, her body collapses into shards of ice, whereupon Auril instantly reappears in her [[Auril (third form)|IDRotF]], in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of where her second form was destroyed. Her initiative count doesn't change.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day in This Form).** If Auril fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Auril has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unusual Nature.** Auril doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Auril attacks twice with her ice morningstar or hurls three ice darts.

**Ice Morningstar.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) cold damage.

**Ice Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) cold damage.

**Cone of Cold (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Auril causes a magical blast of cold air to erupt from her hand. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (**8d8**) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Create Ice Mephit (3/Day).** Auril breaks off an icicle from her body and hurls it into an unoccupied space she can see within 20 feet of her, where it magically transforms into an [[ice mephit]] (see its entry in the Monster Manual). The mephit acts immediately after Auril in the initiative order and obeys her commands.

**Ice Stasis {@recharge 5}.** Auril magically creates a gem-sized ice crystal that hovers in a space within 5 feet of her. Auril then targets a creature she can see within 60 feet of the crystal. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw or become trapped in the crystal, which is immovable. If the saving throw succeeds, the crystal shatters and nothing else happens. A creature trapped in the crystal is [[stunned]], has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the crystal, and takes 21 (**6d6**) cold damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, freeing itself on a success. The creature is also freed if the crystal is destroyed, which is a Tiny object with AC 18, 9 hit points, and immunity to all damage except fire damage. The freed creature appears in an unoccupied space of its choice within 30 feet of the shattered crystal.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** Auril makes one weapon attack.

**Ice Flurry (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within 30 feet of Auril takes 5 (**2d4**) piercing damage from swirling ice, and nonmagical, open flames in that area are extinguished.

**Splinter (Costs 3 Actions).** Auril uses Create Ice Mephit or causes one to ice mephit she can see within 60 feet of her to explode and die. A mephit that dies in this way does not use its Death Burst. Instead, each creature within 10 feet of the exploding mephit must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (**3d8**) piercing damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.
