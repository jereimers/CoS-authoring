## Traits

**Banded Claw.** On one of its claws, the crab wears a rune-covered copper band that makes it immune to being [[charmed]], [[frightened]], and [[paralyzed]]. The copper band is worthless as a treasure, as the magic is keyed to this crab.

**Amphibious.** The crab can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h27 (**4d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]], escape DC 14. The crab has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
