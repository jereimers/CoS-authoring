**Chaos Claw.** m +8, reach 10 ft. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) Slashing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) Necrotic damage. Until the start of the slaad's next turn, the target has a condition determined by rolling `1d4`: on a 1, [[Charmed|XPHB]]; on a 2, [[Frightened|XPHB]]; on a 3, [[Poisoned|XPHB]]; or on a 4, [[Incapacitated|XPHB]].
