# Command

*1st-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. Choose the command from these options:

- **Approach:** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.
- **Drop:** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
- **Flee:** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
- **Grovel:** The target has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition and then ends its turn.
- **Halt:** On its turn, the target doesn't move and takes no action or [[Bonus Action|XPHB]].

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

You can affect one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.
