## Traits

**Martial Advantage.** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 14 (**4d6**) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hobgoblin makes three melee attacks. Alternatively, it can make two ranged attacks with its javelins.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) slashing damage, or 8 (**1d10 + 3**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Shield Bash.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `d4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is [[incapacitated]].



## Reactions

**Parry.** The hobgoblin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the hobgoblin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
