# Astral Drifter

- **Skill Proficiencies::** [[Insight]], [[Religion]]
- **Languages::** Two of your choice ([[Celestial]] or [[Gith|MM]] recommended)
- **Equipment::** A set of [[traveler's clothes|PHB]], a diary, an [[ink pen|PHB]], a [[Ink (1-ounce bottle)|PHB]], and a [[pouch|phb]] containing 10 gp

## Longevity

You are `20d6` years older than you look, because you have spent that much time in the Astral Sea without aging.

## Feature: Divine Contact

You gain the [[Magic Initiate|]] from the [[Player's Handbook|PHB]] and must choose cleric for the feat.

In the Astral Sea, you crossed paths with a wandering deity. The encounter was brief and nonviolent, yet it made a lasting impression on you. This deity saw fit to share one secret or obscure bit of cosmic lore with you. Work with your DM to determine the details of this knowledge and its impact on the campaign.

Roll on the Divine Contact table to determine which deity you encountered, or work with your DM to identify a more suitable choice.
