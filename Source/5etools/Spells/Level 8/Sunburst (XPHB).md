Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **12d6** Radiant damage and has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

A creature [[Blinded|XPHB]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This spell dispels [[Darkness|XPHB]] in its area that was created by any spell.
