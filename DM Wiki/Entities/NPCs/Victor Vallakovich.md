## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Victor is a quiet, moody, and isolated young man with an awkward manner and a total lack of social graces. To those he trusts, Victor is a devoted and compassionate friend, with a spark of brilliance and the stubbornness of a mule. Only Victor knows that he secretly fears losing Stella’s friendship—both due to the harm caused by his *teleportation circle* and due to the time she’s spent with Erasmus van Richten in the Ethereal Plane.

### Morale
In a fight, Victor would attempt to flee, but would resort to his most dangerous spells with wanton and amateurish abandon if cornered or if defending his friends or family.

### Relationships
Victor is the only child of [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] and Baroness Lydia Petrovna. He is a close friend to Stella Wachter, and a friendly (though wary) acquaintance to the ghost of Erasmus van Richten. Victor despises and fears [[Izek Strazni]], who killed Victor’s childhood cat, Murka, by kicking it across a room when it wandered into his path two years ago. (Victor has since reanimated Murka’s skeleton through the use of his *animate dead* spell.)

### Knowledge
If persuaded to aid the players in finding [[Arabelle]], Victor can share the following information:

* Three years ago, he found an old spellbook in his father’s library. He’s used it to study magic ever since.
* The original owner of the spellbook was a mage named [[Khazan]]. The symbol on the cover of the spellbook was his personal sigil.
* Long ago, Khazan built a wizard’s tower, which he imbued with powerful enchantments, including a protective field that prevented any other spellcasters from using magic within its reach.
