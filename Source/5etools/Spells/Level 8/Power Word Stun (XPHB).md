# Power Word Stun

*8th-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] or fewer, it has the [[Stunned|XPHB]] condition. Otherwise, its [[Speed|XPHB]] is 0 until the start of your next turn.

The [[Stunned|XPHB]] target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.
