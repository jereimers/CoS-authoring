# Perfume of Bewitching

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This tiny vial contains magic perfume, enough for one use. You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to apply the perfume to yourself, and its effect lasts 1 hour. For the duration, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on all Charisma ([[Deception|XPHB]] and [[Persuasion|XPHB]]) checks made to influence a creature within 5 feet of yourself.
