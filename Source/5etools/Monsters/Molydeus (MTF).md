## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the molydeus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The molydeus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The molydeus' weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The molydeus makes three attacks: one with its weapon, one with its wolf bite, and one with its snakebite.

**Demonic Weapon.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h20 (**2d10 + 9**) slashing damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra **6d8** slashing damage from the hit.

**Wolf Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d6 + 9**) piercing damage.

**Snakebite.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. @h12 (**1d6 + 9**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a [[manes]] if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a [[wish]] spell.

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** The molydeus makes one attack, either with its demonic weapon or with its snakebite.

**Move.** The molydeus moves without provoking opportunity attacks.
