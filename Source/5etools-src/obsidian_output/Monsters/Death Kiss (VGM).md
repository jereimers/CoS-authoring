## Traits

**Lightning Blood.** A creature within 5 feet of the death kiss takes 5 (**1d10**) lightning damage whenever it hits the death kiss with a melee attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The death kiss makes three tentacle attacks. Up to three of these attacks can be replaced by Blood Drain, one replacement per tentacle grappling a creature

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14) if it is a Huge or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the death kiss can't use the same tentacle on another target. The death kiss has ten tentacles.

**Blood Drain.** One creature [[grappled]] by a tentacle of the death kiss must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (**4d10**) lightning damage, and the death kiss regains half as many hit points.
