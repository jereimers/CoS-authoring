## Traits

**Death Burst.** When the cinder hulk dies, it leaves behind a cloud of cinders and smoke that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on its space. The sphere is heavily obscured. Any creature that moves into the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) fire damage. The cloud lasts for 1 minute or until it is dispersed by strong wind.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cinder hulk makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) fire damage.

**Wave of Cinders {@recharge 5}.** The cinder hulk emits a wave of smoldering ash from its face, hands, or chest in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 (**7d8**) fire damage and has the [[blinded]] condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
