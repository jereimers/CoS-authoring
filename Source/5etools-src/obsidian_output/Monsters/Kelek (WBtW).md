## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Kelek wears [[bracers of defense]] and carries a [[staff of striking]] with 10 charges. The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a `d20`; on a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Kelek makes three attacks using Sorcerer's Bolt, Staff of Striking, or a combination of them. He can replace one of the attacks with a use of Spellcasting.

**Sorcerer's Bolt.** Attack (ms,rs) +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d12**) force damage.

**Staff of Striking.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, or 9 (**1d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands, and Kelek can expend up to 3 of the staff's charges, dealing an extra 3 (**1d6**) force damage for each expended charge.

**Fiery Explosion {@recharge 4}.** Kelek creates a magical explosion of fire centered on a point he can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (**10d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Arcane Defense (3/Day).** When he is hit by an attack, Kelek protects himself with an [[invisible]] barrier of magical force. Until the end of his next turn, he gains a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack.
