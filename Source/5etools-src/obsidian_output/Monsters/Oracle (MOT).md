## Traits

**Blessings of the Gods.** While the oracle is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier. In addition, a creature that hits the oracle with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 9 (**2d8**) force damage.


## Actions

**Eldritch Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) force damage.



## Reactions

**Divine Insight (3/Day).** When the oracle or a creature it can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, the oracle can cause the roll to be made with advantage or disadvantage.
