## Traits

**Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

**Antimagic Susceptibility.** The hut is [[incapacitated]] while the magic gem that animates it is in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the hut must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**Siege Monster.** The hut deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hut makes three attacks with its roots. It can replace one of these attacks with a rock attack.

**Root.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. @h30 (**4d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.
