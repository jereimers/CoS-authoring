# Mass Cure Wounds

*5th-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point you can see within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on that point. Each target regains [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to `5d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The healing increases by `5d8` for each spell slot level above 5.
