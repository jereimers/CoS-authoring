## Traits

**Focused Conjuration.** While Var is [[concentration]] on a conjuration spell, his [[concentration]] can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Var fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Rejuvenation.** If Var is destroyed but his phylactery remains intact, Var gains a new body in `1d10` days, regaining all his hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.

**Turn Resistance.** Var has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.


## Actions

**Paralyzing Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**3d6**) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Benign Transposition.** Var teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Alternatively, he can choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium creature. If that creature is willing, both creatures teleport, swapping places. Var can use this feature again only after he finishes a long rest or casts a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Cantrip.** Var casts a cantrip.

**Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).** Var uses Paralyzing Touch.

**Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).** Var fixes his gaze on one creature he can see within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to Var's gaze for the next 24 hours.
