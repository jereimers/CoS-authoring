## Actions

**Multiattack.** Edgin makes two Reinforced Lute or Shortsword attacks.

**Reinforced Lute.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (**2d10**) thunder damage.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) thunder damage.

**Disorienting Words.** Edgin magically taunts up to three creatures he can see within 60 feet of himself. Each creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of Edgin's next turn.



## Reactions

**Inspiring Words (3/Day).** When a creature Edgin can see within 60 feet of himself fails an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, Edgin grants the creature magical encouragement. The creature can roll a `d8` and add the number rolled to the total, potentially turning the failure into a success.
