* **Dag**, who married into the Martikov family, takes no position on Davian’s feud with Urwin, though he shares Stefania’s position that Elric’s death was a tragedy but his choice deserves respect. He most often feels amused, thoughtful, playful, or determined, and should make the players feel grateful, amused, and endeared to him.
