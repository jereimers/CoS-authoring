# Syluné's Viper

*3rd-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a snake fang)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

---

A shimmering, spectral snake encircles your body for the duration. You gain 15 [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]]; the spell ends early if you have no [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] left.

While the spell is active, you gain the following benefits:

- **Climbing:** You gain a [[Climb Speed|XPHB]] equal to your [[Speed|XPHB]].
- **Venomous Bite:** As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can make a ranged spell attack using the snake against one creature within 50 feet. On a hit, the target takes **1d6** Force damage and has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition until the start of your next turn. While [[Poisoned|XPHB]], the target has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

For each spell slot level above 3, the number of [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] you gain from this spell increases by 5, and the damage of Venomous Bite increases by `1d6`.
