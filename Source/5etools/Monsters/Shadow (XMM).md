**Sunlight Weakness.** While in sunlight, the shadow has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on [[D20 Test|XPHB]].


## Actions

**Draining Swipe.** m +4, reach 5 ft. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) Necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score decreases by `1d4`. The target dies if this reduces that score to 0. If a Humanoid is slain by this attack, a Shadow rises from the corpse `1d4` hours later.


## Bonus Actions

**Shadow Stealth.** While in [[Dim Light|XPHB]] or [[Darkness|XPHB]], the shadow takes the Hide action.
