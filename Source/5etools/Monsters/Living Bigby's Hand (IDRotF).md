## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The living spell has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unusual Nature.** The living spell doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Force Fist.** Melee Spell Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h26 (**4d8 + 8**) force damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, the living spell can move it up to 5 feet and move with it, without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Grasping Hand.** The living spell attempts to grab a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 15 (**2d6 + 8**) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The living spell can grapple only one creature at a time and can't use Force Fist until the grapple ends.
