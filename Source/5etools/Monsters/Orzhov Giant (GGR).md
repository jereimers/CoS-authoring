## Traits

**Focus.** As a bonus action, the giant can target a creature it can see within 30 feet of it and make that creature its focus. The target remains the giant's focus for 1 minute, or until either the target or the giant drops to 0 hit points. When the giant makes an attack roll against its focus, it adds a `d4` to its attack roll. If the giant attacks a different target while it has a focus, it subtracts a `d4` from its attack roll.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two greataxe attacks.

**Greataxe.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h25 (**3d12 + 6**) slashing damage. If the Orzhov giant scores a critical hit, it rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.
