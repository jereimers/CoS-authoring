# Scene order
1. [[X2a - The Discovery]]
2. [[X2b - What Blinsky Knows]]
3. [[X2c - Investigating the Scene]]

## Intro
%% 
This is not canon, but its starting point requires only minor tweaks to the existing story thus far. 
## RetCons
- Madam Eva's gift was requested not for Arabelle's nameday, but instead for the Long Night.
- Eva shared lore about Long Night.
- The date of their arrival in Vallaki. Instead of arriving on Neyavr 2, they have arrived on Dekavr 19 -- just three days before the Long Night. 
- Their encounters with NPCs from Session 9 will remain almost exactly the same, with one key change: the Baron's next festival is to be the "Festival of Enduring Light", not the "Festival of the Blazing Sun".

### The lore Eva shared

- ![[The Long Night#A Night of Remembrance and Resistance]]
- ![[The Long Night#Origins]]
- ![[The Long Night#Common Traditions Across Barovia]]
- ![[The Long Night#Regional Variations]]

### What you saw in Vallaki

- Forced carolers singing the same song: "All will be well"
- A bonfire (unlit), partially set up and under guard in the town square.
- 

It's mid-Dekavr in Vallaki, and the town is soft with pillowy snow. You awake in one big bed to find that Choppy is missing; you hear groans from the en suite bathroom and find a note stuck to the door. 
It reads, "accidentally cast Ray of Sickness on self" in hurriedly scrawled ink. 

Downstairs, Urwin fixes breakfast. The party can partake. Rictavio can appear as described in [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C12c. Morning in Vallaki|Morning in Vallaki]], but instead of retrieving a parcel he'll simply  be taking coffee back up to his room. (Don't wanna make the players suspicious of Rictavio right now or follow him to his wagon since it won't lead anywhere Grinchy). 

From here, the party could head directly to Blinsky's or they could go to the church to pick up Ireena. If they go to the church, the bones have not yet been stolen and nothing is the matter. 

On their way to Blinsky's, they witness 5 children playing jumprope and singing the song described in [[Arc X - The Long Night & the Grinch of Mt. Crumpit#X1a. The Children's Song|The Children's Song]].

At Blinsky's, run [[X2a - The Discovery]]
Remember to play Blinsky in line with 
![[Arc X - The Long Night & the Grinch of Mt. Crumpit#^Abstract-Blinskys-Emotional-State]]



# Notes
- The children seen playing in the street in the poor quarter are Milivoj's siblings
- The party could get cold weather gear from Szoldar and Yevgeni if they think to ask.
- Describe the ascent as like an icy version of the Stair of Cirith-Ungol

# To Do
- Need to make a visual map of the journey from Blinsky's to Mt Crumpit
- Specify the maps for Grinch's lair
