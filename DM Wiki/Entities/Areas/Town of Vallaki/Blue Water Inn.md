# Overview
Gray smoke issues from the chimney of this large, two-story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof, upon which several ravens have perched. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall.

# What the party knows
- The Blue Water Inn is Vallaki's main gathering place for locals, especially at night. The innkeeper, [[Urwin Martikov]], considers the inn a sanctuary from the evils of this land. In the event of trouble, the windows and doors can all be barred shut from within.
- A bed for the night costs **1 ep**. Characters looking for something to eat are fed hot beet soup and fresh bread at no additional charge. A cooked wolf steak costs **1 ep**.
- The inn offers a pint of Purple Grapemash No. 3 wine for **3 cp**, or a pint of the superior Red Dragon Crush wine for **1 sp**. [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] is hurt if the characters complain about the wines, for his family makes them.
- There's a hayloft (map area h) above the stable in which hundreds of ravens roost overnight. It contains a chest, which the ravens seem to protect, and a secret door that connects to the inn's master bedroom.

# Notable figures
- [[Urwin Martikov]] and [[Danika Dorakova]] -- proprietors and innkeepers, parents to [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] and [[Brom Martikov|Brom]].
- [[Rictavio]] -- ostentatious carnival ringleader, fellow guest, storyteller extraordinaire.
- [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] -- grizzled Vallakian wolf-hunters (*also leftist homies*).
