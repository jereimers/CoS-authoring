## Traits

**Fey Step {@recharge 4}.** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Joyful Presence.** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [[charmed]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Joyful Presence for 24 hours.

Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [[charmed]] creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Magic Resistance.** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The eladrin makes two weapon attacks. The eladrin can cast one spell in place of one of these attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) slashing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) psychic damage, or 7 (**1d10 + 2**) slashing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) psychic damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) psychic damage.
