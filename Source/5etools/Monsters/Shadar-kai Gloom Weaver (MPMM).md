## Traits

**Burden of Time.** Beasts and Humanoids (except elves) have disadvantage on saving throws while within 10 feet of the shadar-kai.

**Fey Ancestry.** The shadar-kai has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put it to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The shadar-kai makes three Shadow Spear attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Shadow Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120, one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 26 (**4d12**) necrotic damage. @homThe spear magically returns to the shadar-kai's hand immediately after a ranged attack.



## Reactions

**Misty Escape {@recharge 6}.** When the shadar-kai takes damage, it turns [[invisible]] and teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It remains [[invisible]] until the start of its next turn or until it attacks or casts a spell.
