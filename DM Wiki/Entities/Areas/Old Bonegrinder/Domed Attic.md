# O4. Domed Attic

You've reached the windmill's peak - a domed chamber filled with old machinery. There's not much room to move around. Light slips into this attic through small holes in the walls.

Characters searching this space find a few old, abandoned bird's nests.

## Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it's easy to find, either tucked in a bird's nest or buried under some dirt in a corner.
