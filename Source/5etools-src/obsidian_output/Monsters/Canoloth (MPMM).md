## Traits

**Dimensional Lock.** Other creatures can't teleport to or from a space within 60 feet of the canoloth. Any attempt to do so is wasted.

**Magic Resistance.** The canoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Uncanny Senses.** The canoloth can't be [[surprised]] unless it's [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The canoloth makes one Bite or Tongue attack and one Claw attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) force damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) slashing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) force damage.

**Tongue.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d12 + 4**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) acid damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15), pulled up to 30 feet toward the canoloth, and [[restrained]] until the grapple ends. The canoloth can grapple one target at a time with its tongue.
