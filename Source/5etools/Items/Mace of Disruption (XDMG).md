# Mace of Disruption

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra **2d6** Radiant damage. If the target has 25 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the end of your next turn.

## Light

While you hold this weapon, it sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 20 feet.
