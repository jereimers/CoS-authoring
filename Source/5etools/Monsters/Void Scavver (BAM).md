## Traits

**Unusual Nature.** The scavver doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Swallowing Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h45 (**6d12 + 6**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the scavver. The scavver can have one creature swallowed at a time.

A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the scavver, and takes 11 (**2d10**) acid damage at the start of each of the scavver's turns from the digestive juices in the scavver's gullet.

If the scavver takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scavver must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the scavver. If the scavver dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].


## Bonus Actions

**Ray of Fear {@recharge 4}.** The scavver's eye emits an [[invisible]], magical ray that targets one creature the scavver can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the scavver until the start of the scavver's next turn.
