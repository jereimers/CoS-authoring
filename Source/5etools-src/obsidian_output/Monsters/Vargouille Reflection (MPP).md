## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The vargouille has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.

**Abyssal Curse.** The vargouille targets one Humanoid within 5 feet of itself that has the [[incapacitated]] condition. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target's Charisma decreases by 1 after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects, and its Charisma can't increase. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a [[daylight]] spell. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, the target dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille reflection. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete ends the curse and restores the target's Charisma.

**Horrific Reflection {@recharge 5}.** The vargouille's head mimics that of a Humanoid the vargouille can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage and have the [[frightened]] condition for 1 hour or until the vargouille loses [[concentration]] (as if [[concentration]] on a spell). If the target's saving throw is successful or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Horrific Reflection of all vargouille reflections for 1 hour.
