# Objective
Help [[Father Donavich]] find a way to save—or destroy—[[Doru]], his son who has been transformed into a [[Vampire Spawn]].

# What the Party knows
- Three months ago, [[Doru]] led an ill-fated rebellion against [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], accompanied by over two dozen young Barovians and a traveling scholar named "Alanik Ray." None returned—save Doru, who stumbled home weeks later as a [[Vampire Spawn]].
- [[Father Donavich]] managed to lure Doru into the undercroft of the [[Church]] and trap him there. Since Doru's return, Donavich hasn't been able to cast spells or feel the Morninglord's presence.
- Doru is desperately trying to resist his vampiric nature. He starves himself and insists on remaining locked in the undercroft, terrified of hurting anyone he loves.
- Doru asked the party to witness him resist the temptation of fresh blood—a test of his will and faith. If he could resist, it would prove that his soul might still be saved.
- Doru successfully resisted the bloodlust, and his fangs retracted. His father's holy symbol now glows with a faint warmth, and [[Father Donavich]] was able to feel the Morninglord's presence once more.

# Leads
- Doru's condition may be curable through powerful magic—a spell of removal can cure an afflicted lycanthrope or vampire spawn, though the cursed may resist.
- [[Father Donavich]] mentioned that there may be priests or healers in [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] who possess greater knowledge of such afflictions.
- The traveling scholar "Alanik Ray" who accompanied Doru's rebellion may know more about vampires and their weaknesses—if he survived.

# Secrets
- "Alanik Ray" was actually Dr. Rudolph van Richten, the legendary vampire hunter, traveling in disguise. Doru forced Van Richten to accompany the rebellion by threatening to march on Castle Ravenloft regardless.
- Van Richten survived the assault on Castle Ravenloft, though his fate afterward is unknown. He is currently in Vallaki, disguised as [[Rictavio]].
- Doru's curse can potentially be lifted by a *remove curse* spell cast by a 5th-level or higher caster, though the process may be difficult and Doru may need to resist Strahd's control.
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] of [[St. Andral's Church]] in Vallaki cannot cast *remove curse* and therefore cannot cure Doru's condition.
