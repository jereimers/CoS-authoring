# Maze

*8th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.

The target can take a [[Study|XPHB]] action to try to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence ([[Investigation|XPHB]]) check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.
