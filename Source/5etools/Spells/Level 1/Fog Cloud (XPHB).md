# Fog Cloud

*1st-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

---

You create a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of fog centered on a point within range. The [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]]. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by [[Gust of Wind|XPHB]]) disperses it.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
