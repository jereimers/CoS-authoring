# Tavern Brawler

You gain the following benefits.

## Enhanced Unarmed Strike

When you hit with your [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]] and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to **1d4** plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]].

## Damage Rerolls

Whenever you roll a damage die for your [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]], you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.

## Improvised Weaponry

You have proficiency with improvised weapons.

## Push

When you hit a creature with an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]] as part of the [[Attack|XPHB]] action on your turn, you can deal damage to the target and also push it 5 feet away from you. You can use this benefit only once per turn.
