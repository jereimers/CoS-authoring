## Traits

**Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

**Antimagic Susceptibility.** The broom is [[incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the broom must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**False Appearance.** While the broom remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal broom.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The broom makes two melee attacks.

**Broomstick.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) bludgeoning damage.



## Reactions

**Animated Attack.** If the broom is motionless and a creature grabs hold of it, the broom makes a Dexterity check contested by the creature's Strength check. If the broom wins the contest, it flies out of the creature's grasp and makes a melee attack against it with advantage on the attack roll.
