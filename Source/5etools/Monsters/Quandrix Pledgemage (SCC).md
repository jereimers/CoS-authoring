## Actions

**Multiattack.** The pledgemage makes two Exponential Lash attacks.

**Exponential Lash.** Attack (ms,rs) +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) force damage, and the pledgemage can cause one creature it can see within 30 feet of the target to take 10 (**2d6 + 3**) force damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Vortex Calculus {@recharge 4}.** The pledgemage teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of itself. Immediately after it teleports, each creature within 20 feet of the space it left must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (**2d6**) force damage and is moved 10 feet in a random horizontal direction. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved.
