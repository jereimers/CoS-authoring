# Lightning Arrow

*3rd-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus (which you take immediately after hitting or missing a target with a ranged attack using a weapon)  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

As your attack hits or misses the target, the weapon or ammunition you're using transforms into a lightning bolt. Instead of taking any damage or other effects from the attack, the target takes **4d8** Lightning damage on a hit or half as much damage on a miss. Each creature within 10 feet of the target then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **2d8** Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The weapon or ammunition then returns to its normal form.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage for both effects of the spell increases by `4d8;2d8` for each spell slot level above 3.
