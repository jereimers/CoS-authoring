Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]]. They disappear when the spell ends.

Each creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the spell ends. A [[Restrained|XPHB]] creature can take an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer [[Restrained|XPHB]] by them.
