## Traits

**Unusual Nature.** The feyr doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The feyr makes one Frightful Bite attack and one Tentacle attack.

**Frightful Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) piercing damage, and each creature within 10 feet of the feyr that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the feyr until the end of the feyr's next turn.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h17 (**4d6 + 3**) psychic damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the feyr can't use this tentacle against other targets. The feyr has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one creature.

**Invisibility.** The feyr becomes [[invisible]] until it attacks, uses Nightmare Fuel, or uses a bonus action to become visible.

**Nightmare Fuel (1/Day).** The feyr targets one [[unconscious]] creature it can see within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 27 (**5d10**) psychic damage, and the feyr gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.
