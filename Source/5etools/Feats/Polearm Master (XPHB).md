# Polearm Master

**Prerequisites:** Level 4, STR 13+, Level 4, DEX 13+

You gain the following benefits.

## Pole Strike

Immediately after you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action and attack with a [[Quarterstaff|XPHB]], a [[Spear|XPHB]], or a weapon that has the Heavy and Reach properties, you can use a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. The weapon deals Bludgeoning damage, and the weapon's damage die for this attack is a `d4`.

## Reactive Strike

While you're holding a [[Quarterstaff|XPHB]], a [[Spear|XPHB]], or a weapon that has the Heavy and Reach properties, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to make one melee attack against a creature that enters the reach you have with that weapon.
