# Calim Sandstorm

Sandstorms arise quickly in the Calim desert, scouring the flesh of those caught inside. A Calim sandstorm is typically at least 300 feet in diameter and lasts **{@dice 1d6**} hours.

The area of a Calim sandstorm is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]], and open flames in the area are extinguished. A creature makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw after each hour spent in a sandstorm's area. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level.
