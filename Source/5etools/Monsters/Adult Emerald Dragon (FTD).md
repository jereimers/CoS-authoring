## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Shift Perception (1/Day).** The dragon can cast [[hallucinatory terrain]], requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17).

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and can leave a 15-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) psychic damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Disorienting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of psychic dissonance in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 42 (**12d6**) psychic damage, and until the end of its next turn, when the creature makes an attack roll or an ability check, it must roll a `d6` and reduce the total by the number rolled. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects.


## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The dragon magically transforms into any creature that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.

**Psychic Step.** The dragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Claw.** The dragon makes one Claw attack.

**Psionics (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon uses Psychic Step or Spellcasting.

**Emerald Embers (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon creates a dancing mote of green flame around a creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 31 (**9d6**) fire damage.
