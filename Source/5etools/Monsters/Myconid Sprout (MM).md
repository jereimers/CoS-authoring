## Traits

**Distress Spores.** When the myconid takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.

**Sun Sickness.** While in sunlight, the myconid has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The myconid dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.


## Actions

**Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h1 (**1d4 - 1**) bludgeoning damage plus 2 (**1d4**) poison damage.

**Rapport Spores (3/Day).** A 10-foot radius of spores extends from the myconid. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
