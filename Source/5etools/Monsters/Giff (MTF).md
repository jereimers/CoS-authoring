## Traits

**Headfirst Charge.** The giff can try to knock a creature over; if the giff moves at least 20 feet in a straight line that ends within 5 feet of a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[prone]].

**Firearms Knowledge.** The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of muskets and pistols.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giff makes two pistol attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Musket.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d12 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Pistol.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Fragmentation Grenade (1/Day).** The giff throws a grenade up to 60 feet. Each creature within 20 feet of the grenade's detonation must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (**5d6**) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
