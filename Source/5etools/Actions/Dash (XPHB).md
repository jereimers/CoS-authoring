# Dash

**Time:** 1 action

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your [[Speed|XPHB]] after applying any modifiers. With a [[Speed|XPHB]] of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your [[Speed|XPHB]] of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.

If you have a special speed, such as a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] or [[Swim Speed|XPHB]], you can use that speed instead of your [[Speed|XPHB]] when you take this action. You choose which speed to use each time you take it.
