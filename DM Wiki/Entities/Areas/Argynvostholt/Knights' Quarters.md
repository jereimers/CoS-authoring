# Q28. Knights' Quarters

Tattered and faded drapes cover the windows of this circular room, and empty torch sconces line the walls. Broken bunk beds and armor stands are strewn on the floor.

%% --- Page 187 --- %%
Three phantom warriors (see appendix D) haunt this room. They manifest only when the characters enter the room or trigger the magic trap in area Q25. They fight until destroyed.

## Treasure 

Buried under the wreckage is a small wooden coffer containing four potions of invulnerability. A search of the room yields this lost cache.
