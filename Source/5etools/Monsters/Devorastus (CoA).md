## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Devorastus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Ooze Cube.** Devorastus takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have Cover. A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 21 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 35 (**10d6**) acid damage. The cube can hold only one Huge creature or up to six Large or smaller creatures inside it at a time.

**Sticky.** Devorastus can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Transparent.** Even when Devorastus is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check to spot Devorastus if it has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter Devorastus' space while unaware of Devorastus is surprised by it.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Devorastus makes four attacks using its Pseudopod, Spit, or a combination of the two.

**Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h42 (**12d6**) acid damage.

**Spit.** Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, range 100/200 ft., one target. @h28 (**8d6**) acid damage. A target hit by this attack must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [[prone]] condition.

**Engulf.** Devorastus moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever Devorastus enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of Devorastus. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, Devorastus enters the creature's space, the creature takes 35 (**10d6**) acid damage, and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, has the [[restrained]] condition, and takes 42 (**12d6**) acid damage at the start of each of Devorastus' turns. When Devorastus moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by making a DC 21 Strength check as an action. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of Devorastus.
