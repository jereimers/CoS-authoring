**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) piercing damage and 5 (**1d10**) cold damage.

**Freezing Breath {@recharge}.** The salamander exhales chill wind in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (**8d10**) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
