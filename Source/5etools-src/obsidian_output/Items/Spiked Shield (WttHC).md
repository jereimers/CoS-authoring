# Spiked Shield

*Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

Crude metal spikes adorn this magic Shield. It has the following properties that you can use while holding it.

## Shield Bash

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your [[Proficiency|XPHB]] and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Piercing damage equal to `2d6` plus your Strength modifier.

## Spike Salvo

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can cause spikes to erupt from the Shield in a 30-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature in the [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d6** Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
