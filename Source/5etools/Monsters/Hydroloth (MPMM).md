## Traits

**Amphibious.** The hydroloth can breathe air and water.

**Magic Resistance.** The hydroloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Secure Memory.** The hydroloth is immune to the waters of the River Styx, as well as any effect that would steal or modify its memories or detect or read its thoughts.

**Watery Advantage.** While submerged in liquid, the hydroloth has advantage on attack rolls.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hydroloth makes two Bite or Claw attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) force damage plus 9 (**2d10**) psychic damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) force damage plus 9 (**2d10**) psychic damage.

**Steal Memory (1/Day).** The hydroloth targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target takes 14 (**4d6**) psychic damage, and it must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the target becomes immune to this hydroloth's Steal Memory for 24 hours. On a failed save, the target loses all proficiencies; it can't cast spells; it can't understand language; and if its Intelligence and Charisma scores are higher than 5, they become 5. Each time the target finishes a long rest, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. A [[greater restoration]] or [[remove curse]] spell cast on the target ends this effect early.

**Teleport.** The hydroloth teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
