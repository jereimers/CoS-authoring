# Protection

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to interpose your [[Shield|XPHB]] if you're holding one. You impose [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on the triggering attack roll and all other attack rolls against the target until the start of your next turn if you remain within 5 feet of the target.
