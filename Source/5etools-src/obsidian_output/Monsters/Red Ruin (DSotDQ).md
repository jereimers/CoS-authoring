## Traits

**Draconic Devotion.** While Red Ruin can see a Dragon that isn't hostile to her, she has advantage on attack rolls.

**Mounted Combat Master.** When Red Ruin is mounted and a creature targets her mount with an attack, Red Ruin can cause the attack to target her instead.

**Mounted Evasion.** When Red Ruin or her mount makes a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage from an effect, they take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Red Ruin makes three Ember Lance attacks.

**Ember Lance.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d12 + 4**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or fall [[prone]].

**Explosive Hand Crossbow {@recharge 5}.** Red Ruin fires an explosive crossbow bolt at a point she can see within 120 feet of herself. When the bolt reaches that point, or if it hits an object early, it detonates in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (**10d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
