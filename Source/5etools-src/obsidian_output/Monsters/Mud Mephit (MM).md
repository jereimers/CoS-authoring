## Traits

**Death Burst.** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of sticky mud. Each Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be [[restrained]] until the end of the creature's next turn.

**False Appearance.** While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary mound of mud.


## Actions

**Fists.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) bludgeoning damage.

**Mud Breath {@recharge}.** The mephit belches viscid mud onto one creature within 5 feet of it. If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be [[restrained]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
