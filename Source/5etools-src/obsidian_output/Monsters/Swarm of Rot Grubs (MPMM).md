## Traits

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny maggot. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +0 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. @h7 (**2d6**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]]. At the end of each of the [[poisoned]] target's turns, the target takes 3 (**1d6**) poison damage. Whenever the [[poisoned]] target takes fire damage, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the [[poisoned]] target ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies.
