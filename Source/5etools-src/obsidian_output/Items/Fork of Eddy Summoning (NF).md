# Fork of Eddy Summoning

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This Tiny tuning fork crackles with harmless, multicolored magical energy. As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can tap the fork against any object to summon an [[Eldritch Eddy|NF]] (see appendix B). The eddy appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The eddy is [[Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB]] to you and your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail to command it, the eddy defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions. It takes its turn immediately after you on your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count. The eddy disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]]. The fork can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
