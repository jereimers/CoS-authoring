## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The shaman has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put it to sleep.


## Actions

**Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, or 6 (**1d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.

**Fungal Rot.** Melee Spell Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Feed on Death.** When a creature within 30 feet of the shaman drops to 0 hit points, the shaman gains 5 (`1d10`) temporary hit points.
