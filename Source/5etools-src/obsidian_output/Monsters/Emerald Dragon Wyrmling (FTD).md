## Traits

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and can leave a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) psychic damage.

**Disorienting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of psychic dissonance in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (**5d6**) psychic damage, and until the end of its next turn, when the creature makes an attack roll or an ability check, it must roll a `d4` and reduce the total by the number rolled. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects.
