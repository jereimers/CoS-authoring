## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Aurelia fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Aurelia has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Aurelia makes three longsword attacks and uses Leadership.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**1d8 + 8**) slashing damage, or 13 (**1d10 + 8**) slashing damage when used with two hands, plus 27 (**6d8**) radiant damage.

**Leadership.** Aurelia utters a few inspiring words to one creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the creature can hear her, it can add a `d10` to one attack roll or saving throw it makes before the start of Aurelia's next turn.

**Warleader's Helix {@recharge 5}.** Ranged Spell Attack +17 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. @h54 (**12d8**) radiant damage, and Aurelia can choose another creature she can see within 10 feet of the target. The second creature regains 27 (`6d8`) hit points.



## Reactions

**Parry.** Aurelia adds 7 to her AC against one melee attack that would hit her. To do so, Aurelia must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

**Unyielding.** When Aurelia is subjected to an effect that would move her, knock her [[prone]], or both, she can use her reaction to be neither moved nor knocked [[prone]].


## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Command Allies.** Aurelia chooses up to three creatures she can see within 30 feet of her. If a chosen creature can see or hear Aurelia, it can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, with advantage on the attack roll.

**Longsword Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Aurelia makes one longsword attack.

**Frighten Foes (Costs 3 Actions).** Aurelia targets up to five creatures she can see within 30 feet of her. Each target must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of her until the end of her next turn. Any target within 5 feet of Aurelia has disadvantage on the saving throw.
