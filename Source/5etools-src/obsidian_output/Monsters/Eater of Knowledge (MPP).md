## Traits

**Brains Devoured.** When the eater of knowledge is first encountered, roll `1d10` to determine the number of brains it has already consumed.

**Magic Resistance.** The eater of knowledge has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The eater of knowledge makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit the same creature and the target is Large or smaller, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the grapple ends.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.

**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Humanoid with the [[incapacitated]] condition. @h45 (**10d8**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the eater of knowledge kills the target by extracting and consuming its brain.
