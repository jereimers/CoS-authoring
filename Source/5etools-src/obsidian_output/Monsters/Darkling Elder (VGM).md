## Traits

**Death Burn.** When the darkling elder dies, magical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 7 (**2d6**) radiant damage and, if the creature can see the light, is [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw is successful, the creature takes half the damage and isn't [[blinded]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The darkling elder makes two melee attacks.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage. If the darkling elder had advantage on the attack roll, the attack deals as: extra 10 (**3d6**) piercing damage.

**Darkness (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The darkling elder casts [[darkness]] without any components. Wisdom is its spellcasting ability.
