You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes **10d12** Psychic damage and can't cast spells or take the [[Magic|XPHB]] action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the [[Greater Restoration|XPHB]], [[Heal|XPHB]], or [[Wish|XPHB]] spell.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
