# Gauntlets of Rage

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

You gain the power of never-ending fury. After you make a melee weapon attack, you automatically enter a special fury for 1 minute. While furious, you can't cast spells, can't verbally communicate, and are immune to the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions. Each time you deal damage, you regain `2d8` hit points and may immediately remove a condition you currently suffer from or end this fury. Additionally, while in this fury, you may spend a spell slot before you make a melee attack. Doing so causes the attack to deal an extra 3 (**1d6**) necrotic damage per level of spell slot expended, if the attack hits. Once used you may not use this fury again until you finish a short or long rest.
