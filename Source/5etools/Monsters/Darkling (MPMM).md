## Traits

**Death Flash.** When the darkling dies, nonmagical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn.

**Light Sensitivity.** While in bright light, the darkling has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage.
