## Traits

**Podling Link.** The plant can see through and communicate telepathically with any of its podlings within 10 miles of it.

**Rejuvenation.** When the plant dies, it returns to life in the place where it died `1d12` months later, unless the ground where it took root is sown with salt or soaked with poison.

**Unusual Nature.** The plant doesn't require sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The plant makes three Vine Lash attacks.

**Vine Lash.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]]. The plant has four vines, each of which can grapple one target.

**Entrapping Pod.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature [[grappled]] by the plant. @h22 (**4d8 + 4**) acid damage, and the target is pulled into the plant's space and enveloped by the pod, and the grapple ends. While enveloped, the target is [[restrained]], and it has Cover against attacks and effects originating outside the pod. The enveloped target must also immediately succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] by the plant's sapping enzymes until it is removed from the pod or the plant dies. The enveloped target doesn't require air and gains 1 level of [[exhaustion]] for each hour it spends in the pod. If the target dies while enveloped, it immediately emerges from the pod as a living podling, wearing or carrying all of the original creature's equipment.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the bodytaker plant that is outside the pod can open the pod and pull the target free with a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the plant dies, the target is no longer [[restrained]] and can escape from the pod by spending 10 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]]. The plant has one pod, which can envelop one creature at a time.
