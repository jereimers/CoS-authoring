# Aasimar

**Size:** Small, Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Celestial Resistance

You have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Necrotic damage and Radiant damage.

## Darkvision

You have [[Darkvision|XPHB]] with a range of 60 feet.

## Healing Hands

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you touch a creature and roll a number of d4s equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]. The creature regains a number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the total rolled. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Light Bearer

You know the [[Light|XPHB]] cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.

## Celestial Revelation

When you reach character level 3, you can transform as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] using one of the options below (choose the option each time you transform). The transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it (no action required). Once you transform, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

Once on each of your turns before the transformation ends, you can deal extra damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra damage equals your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and the extra damage's type is either Necrotic for Necrotic Shroud or Radiant for Heavenly Wings and Inner Radiance.

Here are the transformation options:

- **Heavenly Wings:** Two spectral wings sprout from your back temporarily. Until the transformation ends, you have a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] equal to your [[Speed|XPHB]].
- **Inner Radiance:** Searing light temporarily radiates from your eyes and mouth. For the duration, you shed [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 10-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, each creature within 10 feet of you takes Radiant damage equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]].
- **Necrotic Shroud:** Your eyes briefly become pools of darkness, and flightless wings sprout from your back temporarily. Creatures other than your allies within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or have the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the end of your next turn.
