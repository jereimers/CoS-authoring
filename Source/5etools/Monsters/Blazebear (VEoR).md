## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The blazebear has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Mist Sight.** The blazebear can see normally through heavily obscured areas created by mist or fog, including areas created by spells such as Fog Cloud.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The blazebear makes two Bite attacks. It can replace one attack with Stunning Gaze if available.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h20 (**2d12 + 7**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) force damage.

**Stunning Gaze {@recharge 5}.** The blazebear targets two creatures it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the start of the blazebear's next turn.



## Reactions

**Antimagic Swipe.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature casting a spell of 3rd level or lower. @h22 (**4d10**) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or the spell fails and has no effect.
