You create a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **2d6** Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can move the sphere up to 30 feet, rolling it along the ground. If you move the sphere into a creature's space, that creature makes the save against the sphere, and the sphere stops moving for the turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. Flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried start [[burning|XPHB]] if touched by the sphere, and it sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 20 feet.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `2d6` for each spell slot level above 2.
