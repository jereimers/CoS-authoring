## Traits

**Bloodheart Stake.** The impaler is magically bound to the ceremonial stake and the sacrificed corpse the ritual caster used to create it. If the impaler is reduced to 0 hit points, it disappears, then re-forms `1d8` hours later in the nearest unoccupied space to the stake and regains all its hit points. The impaler dies only if it is reduced to 0 hit points while either the ceremonial stake is removed from the sacrifice's corpse or the impaler is on a different plane of existence from that corpse.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the impaler fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The impaler makes one Spike attack and two Wicked Spear attacks.

**Spike.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) piercing damage, and the target's speed is halved until the start of the impaler's next turn.

**Wicked Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 20/40 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) necrotic damage.

**Spike Burst {@recharge 5}.** Twisted, spectral spikes shoot out from the impaler's body. Each creature within 30 feet of the impaler must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 (**9d8**) force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Speed Spike.** The impaler teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It can then make a Spike attack.

**Deepen Wounds (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature whose speed is currently reduced by the impaler's Spike attack takes 18 (**4d8**) necrotic damage.
