## Traits

**Amphibious.** The crab can breathe air and water.

**Shell Camouflage.** While the crab remains motionless with its eyestalks and pincers tucked close to its body, it resembles a natural formation or a pile of detritus. A creature within 30 feet of it can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([[Nature]]) check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The crab makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d10 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). The crab has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target
