# Lash of Shadows (Dormant)

*Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement)*

This snakeskin whip is touched by the power of Zehir and ends in five animated serpent heads.

## Sentience

The Lash of Shadows is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Draconic.

## Personality

A mad [[marilith]] named Sizlifeth lives within the Lash of Shadows. The weapon has a short temper and experiences only extreme emotions. It is most happy when dealing harm.

## Dormant

The whip grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Draconic.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- You can attempt to poison any creature that is hit by the whip. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of one of the following poisons of your choice; once a poison other than Serpent Venom has been used, that poison can't be used again until the next dawn:
- - **Dead Eyes:** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison is [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the creature is [[blinded]].
- **Serpent Venom:** A creature that fails the saving throw against this poison takes **3d6** poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

> **Betrayer Artifact Properties**
> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property and one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property and an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.
