## Traits

**Beheaded Form.** When created, a death's head takes one of three forms: Aberrant Head, Gnashing Head, or Petrifying Head. This form determines the creature's attack.

**Unusual Nature.** The death's head doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Gnashing Bite (Gnashing Head Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage.

**Mind-Bending Bite (Aberrant Head Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw or it can't take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, the target must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

**Petrifying Bite (Petrifying Head Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[restrained]] as it begins to turn to stone. The target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the target is [[petrified]] for 10 minutes.
