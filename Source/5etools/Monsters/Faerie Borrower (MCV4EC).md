## Traits

**Flyby.** The faerie doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.


## Actions

**Needle Blade.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d4 + 5**) piercing damage.

**Magic Mockery.** The faerie hurls magical taunts at one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 3 (**1d6**) psychic damage and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of the faerie's next turn.



## Reactions

**Tricksy Parry.** Immediately after taking damage, the faerie reduces the damage taken by 2 (`1d4`).
