You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point you can see within range. While in this area, creatures have the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Deafened|XPHB]] conditions, and they can't cast spells with a Verbal component.

When the storm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **2d10** Radiant damage and **2d10** Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by `2d10` for each spell slot level above 5.
