# Who they are

Son of the late [[Kolyan Indirovich]], brother to [[Ireena Kolyana]], and recently sworn-in burgomaster of [[Village of Barovia|Barovia]].

# What the party knows

- He is sometimes mockingly called "Ismark the Lesser" — a direct comparison to his great-grandfather, Ismark Antonovich "the Great", who was a a mighty warrior and the burgomaster of the village of Barovia. 
	- In Ismark the Great's prime, he fought scores of vampires and other undead left behind when Strahd vanished from public view. He eventually died defending a group of trappers from a dire wolf attack at the age of 44, and the statue outside was erected in his honor.
- After [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s forces began assaulting the [[Village of Barovia|village]], Ismark coordinated the village defenses and fought on the front line.

# Personality

To the world, Ismark is a courageous, reliable, and compassionate leader. To those he trusts, Ismark is a self-doubting, struggling warrior desperate to keep his loved ones safe.

# Where we've seen them

- [[Session 05 - Out of Barovia#Morning in the Mansion|Session 05]] — He gave you a [[Ismark's Letter of Introduction|letter of introduction]] as he bade you farewell and safe travels through the [[Barovia|Valley of Barovia]]
