## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The derro has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the derro has disadvantage on attack rolls.


## Actions

**Chaos Blast.** Attack (ms,rs) +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d6**) damage. Roll a `d4` to determine the damage type: 1, acid; 2, cold; 3, fire; 4, lightning.

**Force Burst {@recharge 4}.** Raw arcane magic bursts out from the derro. Each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (**2d6**) force damage and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
