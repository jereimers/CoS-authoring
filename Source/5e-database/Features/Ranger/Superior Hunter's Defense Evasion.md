# Superior Hunter's Defense: Evasion

**Class:** [[Ranger]]  
**Level:** 15

When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.
