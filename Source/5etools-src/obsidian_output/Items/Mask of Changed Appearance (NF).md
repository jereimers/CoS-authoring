# Mask of Changed Appearance

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This jeweled mask has 3 charges. As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can expend 1 charge and change your face's appearance. You can't make yourself look like a different person, but you can smooth or deepen your wrinkles, whiten your teeth, hide or accentuate bags under your eyes, or perform other minor cosmetic changes. While your appearance is changed, the mask has the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition. Your changed appearance lasts 1 hour.

## Regaining Charges

The mask regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the mask explodes in a harmless cloud of sweet-swelling powder and is destroyed.
