## Traits

**Divine Eminence.** As a bonus action, Prophetess can expend a spell slot to cause her melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (**3d6**) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If Prophetess expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by **1d6** for each level above 1st.

**Fey Ancestry.** Prophetess has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put her to sleep.


## Actions

**Maul.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.
