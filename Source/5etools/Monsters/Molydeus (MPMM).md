## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the molydeus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The molydeus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The molydeus makes one Demonic Weapon attack, one Snakebite attack, and one Wolf Bite attack.

**Demonic Weapon.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h35 (**4d12 + 9**) force damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 27 (**6d8**) force damage from the hit.

**Snakebite.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. @h16 (**2d6 + 9**) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a [[manes]] if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a [[wish]] spell.

**Wolf Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h25 (**3d10 + 9**) necrotic damage.

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** The molydeus makes one Demonic Weapon or Snakebite attack.

**Move.** The molydeus moves without provoking [[opportunity attack|]].

**Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** The molydeus uses Spellcasting.
