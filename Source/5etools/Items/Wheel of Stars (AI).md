# Wheel of Stars

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws, and you can use an action to cast the [[dancing lights]], [[guidance]], or [[message]] cantrips.

## Portent of the Stars

As a reaction when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you make that creature roll a `d10` and add or subtract the number rolled (your choice) from the roll. Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

## Alter Gravity

As an action, you can cast [[fly]] on yourself or you can cast [[levitate]] (save DC 15). Once you use this feature of the wheel of stars, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

## Part of a Whole

While this component is not installed in the [[Orrery of the Wanderer|AI]], its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
