# Blessing of Dumathoin

*Blessing*

Your eyes become keen enough to pick out hidden secrets. You gain [[darkvision]]. If you already had [[darkvision]], you can see in color in the dark. In addition, you can use an action to gain [[truesight]] for 1 minute. Once you gain [[truesight]] in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
