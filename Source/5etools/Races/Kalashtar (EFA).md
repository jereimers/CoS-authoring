You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.

You have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Psychic damage.

## Mind Link

You have telepathy with a range in feet equal to 10 times your level. When you're using this trait to speak telepathically to a creature, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to give that creature the ability to speak telepathically with you for 1 hour or until you take another [[Magic|XPHB]] action to end this effect.
