## Traits

**Dragon Wings.** As a bonus action on his turn, Zindar can sprout a pair of dragon wings from his back, gaining a flying speed of 30 feet until he dismisses them as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, or 6 (**1d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands.

**Breath Weapon {@recharge 5}.** Zindar uses one of the following options:

**Fire Breath.** Zindar exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Weakening Breath.** Zindar exhales gas in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
