# Lute of Thunderous Thumping

*Item, Very Rare*

This reinforced [[lute|XPHB]] can be wielded as a magic Club that deals an extra **2d8** Thunder damage on a hit.

## Sing and Swing

If you're a Bard, you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier when making a melee attack roll with the [[lute|XPHB]], provided you sing or hum while making the attack.
