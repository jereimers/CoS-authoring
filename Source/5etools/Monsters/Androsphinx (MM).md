## Traits

**Inscrutable.** The sphinx is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom ([[Insight]]) checks made to ascertain the sphinx's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

**Magic Weapons.** The sphinx's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sphinx makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Roar (3/Day).** The sphinx emits a magical roar. Each time it roars before finishing a long rest, the roar is louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.

- **First Roar:** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Second Roar:** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is [[deafened]] and [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] creature is [[paralyzed]] and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Third Roar:** Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (**8d10**) thunder damage and is knocked [[prone]]. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Claw Attack.** The sphinx makes one claw attack.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** The sphinx magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).** The sphinx casts a spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as normal.
