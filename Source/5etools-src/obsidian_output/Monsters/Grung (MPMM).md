## Traits

**Amphibious.** The grung can breathe air and water.

**Poisonous Skin.** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A [[poisoned]] creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Standing Leap.** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

**Water Dependency.** If the grung isn't immersed in water for at least 1 hour during a day, it suffers 1 level of [[exhaustion]] at the end of that day. The grung can recover from this [[exhaustion]] only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage plus 5 (**2d4**) poison damage.
