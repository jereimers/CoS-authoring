## Traits

**Diabolical Restoration.** If the devil dies outside the Nine Hells, its body disappears in sulfurous smoke, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] somewhere in the Nine Hells.

**Magic Resistance.** The devil has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The devil makes three Ice Spear attacks. It can replace one attack with a Tail attack.

**Ice Spear.** m,r +10, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) Piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) Cold damage. Until the end of its next turn, the target can't take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] or [[Reaction|XPHB]], its [[Speed|XPHB]] decreases by 10 feet, and it can move or take one action on its turn, not both. @homThe spear magically returns to the devil's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

**Tail.** m +10, reach 10 ft. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) Bludgeoning damage plus 18 (**4d8**) Cold damage.
