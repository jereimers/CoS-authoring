# Magic Circle

*3rd-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** 10 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (salt and powdered silver worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

---

You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] intersects with the floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:

- The creature can't willingly enter the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
- The creature has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against targets within the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]].
- Targets within the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] can't be possessed by or gain the [[Charmed|XPHB]] or [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition from the creature.

Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] and protecting targets outside it.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3.
