# Lordly Resolve

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Standard Bearer

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], choose up to three creatures within 60 feet of yourself that can see you. Each target can immediately take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to right itself and end the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition, provided its [[Speed|XPHB]] isn't 0. Additionally, you bolster the targets' resolve, which lasts for 1 minute or until you have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition. While bolstered, a target can't be possessed or gain the [[Charmed|XPHB]] or [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition; if a target is already possessed, [[Charmed|XPHB]], or [[Frightened|XPHB]], the target has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
