## Traits

**Whispering Aura.** At the start of each of the warlock's turns, each creature of its choice within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage, provided that the warlock isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The warlock makes two Dagger attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.

**Howling Void.** The warlock opens a momentary extraplanar rift within 60 feet of it. The rift is a scream-filled, 20-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 9 (**2d8**) psychic damage and is [[frightened]] of the warlock until the start of the warlock's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[frightened]].
