## Traits

**Damage Transfer.** While it is grappling a creature, the memory web takes only half the damage dealt to it, and the creature [[grappled]] by the web takes the other half.

**False Appearance.** If the memory web is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the memory web move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the memory web is animate.

**Memory Flood.** When the memory web is reduced to 0 hit points, it discharges any memories it consumed over the past 24 hours in a telepathic deluge. Hazy, dreamlike visions of these discharged memories lodge in the minds of creatures up to 120 feet from the memory web.


## Actions

**Ensnare.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. @hThe target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition and takes 7 (**1d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The memory web can grapple only one creature at a time.


## Bonus Actions

**Drain Memories.** The memory web targets one creature [[grappled]] by it. The target must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw. Constructs, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically. On a failed save, the target takes 5 (**2d4**) psychic damage and becomes memory drained until it finishes a long rest or the memory web is destroyed.

While memory drained, the target must roll a `d4` each time it makes an ability check or attack roll, subtracting the `d4` roll from it. Each time the target is memory drained beyond the first, the die size increases by one: the `d4` becomes a `d6`, the `d6` becomes a `d8`, and so on until the die becomes a `d20`, at which point the target has the [[unconscious]] condition for 1 hour. If a memory drained creature is the target of the Greater Restoration or [[Heal]] spell, the memory drained effect ends on it. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
