## Traits

**Nilbogism.** Any creature that attempts to damage the nilbog must first succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be [[charmed]] until the end of the creature's next turn. A creature [[charmed]] in this way must use its action praising the nilbog.

The nilbog can't regain hit points, including through magical healing, except through its Reversal of Fortune reaction.


## Actions

**Fool's Scepter.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Mocking Word.** The nilbog targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (**2d4**) psychic damage and have disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Nimble Escape.** The nilbog takes the [[Disengage]] or [[Hide]] action.


## Reactions

**Reversal of Fortune.** In response to another creature dealing damage to the nilbog, the nilbog reduces the damage to 0 and regains 3 (`1d6`) hit points.
