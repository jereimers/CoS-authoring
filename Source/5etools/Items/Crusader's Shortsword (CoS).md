# Crusader's Shortsword

*Item, Unknown (Magic)* *(requires attunement)*

The Crusader's Shortsword is a sentient lawful good [[+1 shortsword]] (Intelligence 11, Wisdom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

The sword's purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:

- The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.
- A lawful good creature can attune itself to the sword in 1 minute.
- While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can use the sword to cast the [[crusader's mantle]] spell. Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn.
