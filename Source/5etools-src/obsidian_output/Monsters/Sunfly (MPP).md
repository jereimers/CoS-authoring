## Actions

**Sting.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h2 (**1d4**) piercing damage. Additionally, if the sunfly is on an Outer Plane, it injects the target with a toxin, the effect of which is determined by the sunfly's location:

**Upper Plane.** The target sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius until the end of its next turn.

**Neutral Plane.** If the target is [[concentration]] on a spell or similar effect, it makes the Constitution saving throw with disadvantage to maintain its [[concentration]].

**Lower Plane.** The target's speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Illumination.** The sunfly sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet, or it uses a bonus action to extinguish the light.
