## Traits

**Axiomatic Mind.** The nonaton can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Combat Ready.** The nonaton has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Disintegration.** If the nonaton dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind anything it was carrying.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nonaton makes three Arm attacks and uses Pillar of Truth or Spellcasting.

**Arm.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the nonaton can't use this arm against other targets. The nonaton has nine arms, each of which can grapple one target.

**Pillar of Truth.** The nonaton chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 60 feet of itself. A 60-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius cylinder of magical force rises from that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 21 (**6d6**) force damage, and the creature reverts to its original form (if it's in a different form) and can't assume a different form until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
