## Traits

**Battlemage.** Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on Zythan's ranged attack rolls.

**Magic Resistance.** Zythan has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Zythan makes three Dagger or Arcane Burst attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Arcane Burst.** Ranged Spell Attack +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h27 (**4d10 + 5**) radiant damage.

**Spirit Fissure {@recharge 4}.** Zythan causes a disruption in arcane energies in a 300-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 65 (**10d12**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Portent (3/Day).** As a reaction to a creature Zythan can see making an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, Zythan rolls a `d20` and chooses whether to use that roll in place of the original roll.
