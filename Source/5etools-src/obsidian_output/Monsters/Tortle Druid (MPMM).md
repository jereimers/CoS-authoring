**Multiattack.** The tortle makes four Claw attacks or two [[Nature]]'s Wrath attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Nature's Wrath.** Ranged Spell Attack +4 to hit, range 90 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) damage of a type chosen by the tortle: cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

**Shell Defense.** The tortle withdraws into its shell. Until it emerges, it gains a +4 bonus to AC and has advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in its shell, the tortle is [[prone]], its speed is 0 and can't increase, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, it can't take reactions, and the only action it can take is a bonus action to emerge.
