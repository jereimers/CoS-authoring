# Ring of Shooting Stars

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You can cast [[Dancing Lights|XPHB]] or [[Light|XPHB]] from the ring.

The ring has 6 charges and regains `1d6` expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.

## Faerie Fire

You can expend 1 charge to cast [[Faerie Fire|XPHB]] from the ring.

## Lightning Spheres

You can expend 2 charges as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain [[Concentration]], up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds [[Dim Light|XPHB]] in a 30-foot radius.

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind [[Cover|XPHB]], the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

| Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage |
|---|---|
| 1 | **4d12** |
| 2 | **5d4** |
| 3 | **2d6** |
| 4 | **2d4** |

## Shooting Stars

You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking **5d4** Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
