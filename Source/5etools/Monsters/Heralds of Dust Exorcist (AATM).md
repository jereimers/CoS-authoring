## Traits

**Incorruptible Vessel.** The exorcist can't be possessed by Celestials, Fiends, or Undead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The exorcist makes two Grave Burst attacks.

**Grave Burst.** Attack (ms,rs) +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d10 + 3**) necrotic or radiant damage (exorcist's choice).

**Admit Entity {@recharge 5}.** The exorcist thins the veil of death for a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself, exposing the target to malevolent entities. The target must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 36 (**8d8**) psychic damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition for 1 minute, during which time it retches and babbles incoherently in a voice that is not its own. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. An [[incapacitated]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
