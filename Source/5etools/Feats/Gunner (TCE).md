# Gunner

You have a quick hand and keen eye when employing firearms, granting you the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency with firearms (see "[[Firearms|DMG]]" in the Dungeon Master's Guide).
- You ignore the LD property of firearms.
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
