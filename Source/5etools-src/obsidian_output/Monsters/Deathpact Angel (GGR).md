**Exploitation of the Debtors.** As a bonus action, the angel targets a creature [[charmed]] by it that it can see within 30 feet of it. The angel deals 11 (**2d10**) necrotic damage to the target, and the angel gains temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

**Flyby.** The angel doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Magic Resistance.** The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The angel makes two attacks with its scythe. It can substitute Chains of Obligation for one of these attacks.

**Scythe.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) slashing damage plus 27 (**6d8**) necrotic damage.

**Chains of Obligation.** The angel targets one creature [[charmed]] by it that it can see within 90 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or become [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
