# Fragment of Attachment

*Fragment Of Suffering*

## Benefit

You can't be [[frightened]] while within 10 feet of an ally. If you're already [[frightened]] and move within 10 feet of an ally, the [[frightened]] condition ends on you.

## Drawback

You have disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws while you aren't within 10 feet of an ally.
