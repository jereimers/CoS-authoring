## Actions

**Multiattack.** The rot blade makes two Entropic Blade or Entropic Javelin attacks.

**Entropic Blade.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage. A creature killed by this attack has its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, reduced to ash. @homThe rot blade can cause the blade to emit a burst of entropic magic in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the weapon. Each creature in that area other than the rot blade must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 6 (**1d12**) necrotic damage. The blade can emit entropic magic in this way only once per turn.

**Entropic Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 13 (**2d12**) necrotic damage. A creature killed by this attack has its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, reduced to ash.
