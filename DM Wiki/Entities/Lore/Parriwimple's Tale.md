[[Parriwimple]] leans forward, eyes wide, hands gesturing with all the gravity of a ghost story.

> “So… there was this chicken, right? Belonged to Mr. Kolyan—uh, Ireena’s pa. Meanest bird I ever met. Big red comb, one eye, beak like a dagger. They called him _Old Murderbeak._”

He nods solemnly.

> “Every mornin’ I’d bring feed to the yard, and that chicken would _wait for me._ Like it knew. Soon as I stepped close—_BAM!_—pecked me right on the shin. Drew blood, too. Every. Single. Time.”

There’s a pause as [[Parriwimple]] pantomimes the attack—awkward, deadpan, and oddly precise. The campfire pops; someone stifles a laugh.

> “So one day, I says to myself, ‘Alright, Parriwimple, today’s the day you outsmart that bird.’ I wore _armor._ Uncle Billy’s old shop apron—leather, thick as stew. Even tied a pot lid to my leg.”

He shakes his head.

> “Didn’t help. The beast flew _at my face!_ Claws like knives! I swung the feed sack, missed, spun around—_bam!_—stepped right in the pig trough. Whole thing tipped over. Mud everywhere. And the chicken just strutted off, proud as a duke.”

[[Parriwimple]] pauses, brow furrowed in thought.

> “Couple days later, I heard the neighbors cooked him. Said he kept twitchin’ on the spit for hours. Didn’t stop ’til someone said a prayer over him.”  
> He shrugs.  
> “Guess he finally found peace. Or maybe he’s waitin’ for me on the other side.”

He grins sheepishly, looking around the fire.

> “Anyway, that’s the story of how I lost a fight to a chicken.”
