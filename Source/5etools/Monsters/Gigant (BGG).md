## Traits

**Spell-Resistant Carapace.** The gigant has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature that makes a spell attack against the gigant has disadvantage on the attack roll.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The gigant makes one Mandibles attack and two Talons attacks.

**Mandibles.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h21 (**4d6 + 7**) slashing damage, and the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 17). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 21 (**4d6 + 7**) slashing damage at the start of each of the gigant's turns. While the gigant is grappling a target, it can't use Mandibles against other targets.

**Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d6 + 7**) slashing damage, and the target is pulled 10 feet straight toward the gigant.

**Scale Dust {@recharge 5}.** The gigant releases magical dust from its wings in a 30-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (**10d8**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a success or failure, the creature has the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 hour. While [[poisoned]] this way, the creature can't regain hit points.


## Bonus Actions

**Drone.** The gigant produces a horrid droning sound by rapidly beating its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the gigant must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) thunder damage and have the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn. The gigant can then fly up to half its flying speed.
