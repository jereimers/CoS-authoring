## Traits

**Amphibious.** The egg hunter can breathe air and water.

**False Appearance.** If the egg hunter is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the egg hunter move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the egg hunter is animate. Dragons have disadvantage on this check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The egg hunter makes two Barbed Proboscis attacks, and it can use Torpor Spores if it's available.

**Barbed Proboscis.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage, and the egg hunter regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

**Torpor Spores {@recharge 5}.** The egg hunter releases a billow of sparkling blue spores. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the egg hunter must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn but not both, and it can't take reactions. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this egg hunter's Torpor Spores for the next 24 hours.



## Reactions

**Rapid Adaptation.** When the egg hunter takes damage, it gives itself resistance to that damage.
