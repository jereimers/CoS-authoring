## Traits

**Chameleon Skin.** The troglodyte has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide.

**Stench.** Any creature other than a troglodyte that starts its turn within 5 feet of the troglodyte must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troglodytes for 1 hour.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the troglodyte has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The troglodyte makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) slashing damage.
