## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the shator's darkvision.

**Keen Smell.** The shator has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Magic Resistance.** The shator has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The shator's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The shator makes one Bite attack or one Poisonous Spit attack (if available) and then makes two Claws attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) acid damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d8 + 7**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) acid damage.

**Poisonous Spit {@recharge 5}.** The shator exhales poisonous spit in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**5d8**) acid damage on a failed save and having the [[paralyzed]] condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
