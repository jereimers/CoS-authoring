## Traits

**Death Burn.** When the darkling elder dies, magical light flashes out from it in a 10-foot radius as its body and possessions, other than metal or magic objects, burn to ash. Any creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (**2d6**) radiant damage and is [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[blinded]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The darkling elder makes two Scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage.
