# Lifedrinker

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra **1d6** Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]] to roll it and regain a number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]).
