# Elemental Essence Shard (Fire)

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This crackling crystal contains the essence of an elemental plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use the following property:

## Property

One target of the spell that you can see catches fire. The burning target takes **2d10** fire damage at the start of its next turn, and then the flames go out.
