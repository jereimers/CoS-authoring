## Traits

**Air Envelope.** If it has at least 1 hit point, the gadabout can generate an air envelope around itself when in a vacuum. This air envelope can sustain the gadabout and one other creature in its space indefinitely.

**Unusual Nature.** The gadabout doesn't require food or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The gadabout makes two Branch attacks.

**Branch.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) slashing damage.

**Wrap.** The gadabout enters the space of a willing Medium or Small creature within 5 feet of itself and gently wraps its branches around the target. The target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 0). Any attempt by the target to escape the grapple causes the gadabout to use its reaction to move into the nearest unoccupied space. While [[grappled]] by the gadabout, the target determines where the gadabout moves on the gadabout's turns and accompanies the gadabout wherever it goes.
