## Building a Mage of High Sorcery Character

Mages of High Sorcery are typically sorcerers, warlocks, or wizards and might have any subclass. Spellcasters who gain their magic through devotion are less likely to be welcomed among the traditionalist mages. Nevertheless, the Mages of High Sorcery are shrewd, and they rarely let unique opportunities or individuals pass them by. Even members of martial classes who train in magic might find a rare place among the group's three orders.

### Mage of High Sorcery Trinkets

When you make your character, roll once on the Mage of High Sorcery Trinkets table instead of on the [[trinket|phb]] in the Player's Handbook for your starting trinket.
