## Traits

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and can leave a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) psychic damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Disorienting Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of psychic dissonance in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 31 (**9d6**) psychic damage, and until the end of its next turn, when the creature makes an attack roll or an ability check, it must roll a `d6` and reduce the total by the number rolled. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects.
