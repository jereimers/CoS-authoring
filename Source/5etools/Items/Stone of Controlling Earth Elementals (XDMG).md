# Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While touching this 5-pound stone to the ground, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to summon an [[Earth Elemental|XMM]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]]. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
