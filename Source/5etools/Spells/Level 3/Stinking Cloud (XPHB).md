# Stinking Cloud

*3rd-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

You create a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]]. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by [[Gust of Wind|XPHB]]) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition until the end of the current turn. While [[Poisoned|XPHB]] in this way, the creature can't take an action or a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]].
