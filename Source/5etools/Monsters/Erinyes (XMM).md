## Traits

**Diabolical Restoration.** If the erinyes dies outside the Nine Hells, its body disappears in sulfurous smoke, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] somewhere in the Nine Hells.

**Magic Resistance.** The erinyes has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Rope.** The erinyes has a magic rope. While bearing it, the erinyes can use the Entangling Rope action. The rope has AC 20, HP 90, and [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Poison and Psychic damage. The rope turns to dust if reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], if it is 5+ feet away from the erinyes for 1 hour or more, or if the erinyes dies. If the rope is damaged or destroyed, the erinyes can fully restore it when finishing a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The erinyes makes three Withering Sword attacks and can use Entangling Rope.

**Withering Sword.** m +8, reach 5 ft. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) Slashing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) Necrotic damage.

**Entangling Rope (Requires Magic Rope).** str DC 16, one creature the erinyes can see within 120 feet. @actSaveFail 14 (**4d6**) Force damage, and the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the rope is destroyed, the erinyes uses a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to release the target, or the erinyes uses Entangling Rope again.



## Reactions

**Parry.** @actTrigger The erinyes is hit by a melee attack roll while holding a weapon. @actResponse The erinyes adds 4 to its AC against that attack, possibly causing it to miss.
