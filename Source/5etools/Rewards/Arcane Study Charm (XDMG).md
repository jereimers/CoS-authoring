# Arcane Study Charm

*Charm*

After spending a [[Long Rest|XPHB]] in your [[Bastion|XDMG]], you gain a magical Charm (see "[[Supernatural Gifts|XDMG]]" in [[chapter 3|XDMG]]) that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[Identify|XPHB]] without expending a spell slot or using Material components. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.
