# Spike Growth

*2nd-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (seven thorns)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

---

The ground in a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]] for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes **2d4** Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a [[Search|XPHB]] action and succeed on a Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]] or [[Survival|XPHB]]) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
