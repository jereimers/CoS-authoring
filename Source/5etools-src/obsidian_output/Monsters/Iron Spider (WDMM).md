## Actions

**Web Cable.** The iron spider shoots out a 6-inch-thick web cable up to 50 feet long, attaching the far end of the cable to a solid surface up to 50 feet away from it. As a bonus action, it can detach the other end of the cable from itself and attach it to a solid surface within 10 feet of it. Once it creates 200 feet of web cable, the spider can't produce any more cable until the next dawn.
