## Actions

**Multiattack.** The tlincalli makes two attacks: one with its longsword or spiked chain, and one with its sting.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) slashing damage, or 8 (**1d10 + 3**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Spiked Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 11) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the tlincalli can't use the spiked chain against another target.

**Sting.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. If it fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the target is also [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
