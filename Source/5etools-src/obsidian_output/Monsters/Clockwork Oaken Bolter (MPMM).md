## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The clockwork has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unusual Nature.** The clockwork doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The clockwork makes two Lancing Bolt attacks or one Lancing Bolt attack and one Harpoon attack.

**Lancing Bolt.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Harpoon.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 12). While [[grappled]] in this way, a creature's speed isn't reduced, but it can move only in directions that bring it closer to the clockwork. A creature takes 5 (**1d10**) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. The clockwork can grapple only one creature at a time with its harpoon.

**Explosive Bolt {@recharge 5}.** The clockwork launches an explosive charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (**5d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Bonus Actions

**Reel In.** The clockwork pulls the creature [[grappled]] by its Harpoon up to 20 feet closer.
