# Horseshoes of a Zephyr

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a [[Magic|XPHB]] action.

While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above a surface. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]]. In addition, the creature can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] levels from extended travel.
