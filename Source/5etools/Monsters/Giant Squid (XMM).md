## Traits

**Water Breathing.** The squid can breathe only underwater.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The squid makes one Bite attack and one Tentacle attack.

**Bite.** m +9, reach 5 ft. @h28 (**4d10 + 6**) Piercing damage.

**Tentacle.** m +9, reach 15 ft. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 16) from one of two tentacles, and the squid can pull the target up to 10 feet straight toward itself.



## Reactions

**Ink Cloud (1/Day).** @actTrigger The squid takes damage while underwater. @actResponse The squid releases ink that fills a 15-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on itself, and the squid moves up to its [[Swim Speed|XPHB]]. The [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]] for 1 minute or until a strong current or similar effect disperses the ink.
