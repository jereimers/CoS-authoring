## Traits

**Bonding.** The hound can magically bond with one creature it can see, immediately after spending at least 1 hour observing that creature while within 30 feet of it. The bond lasts until the hound bonds with a different creature or until the bonded creature dies. While bonded, the hound and the bonded creature can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 100 feet.

**Keen Hearing and Smell.** The hound has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on hearing or smell.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
