## Traits

**Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

**Antimagic Susceptibility.** The portrait is [[incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the portrait must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or become [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**False Appearance.** While the figure in the portrait remains motionless, the portrait is indistinguishable from a normal painting.
