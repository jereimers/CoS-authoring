%% An item is an artifact, relic, piece of equipment or gear that players can obtain and/or interact with. Items have owners, locations, histories, and optional magical qualities and/or stat blocks. %%

# Description
A player seeking **harmony** begins the campaign with the *stone crest*, a flat, round stone engraved with the image of a three-pointed star. On the nights of the new moon, the star seems to glimmer with emerald light.

# Notes
The player who possesses the *stone crest* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the symbols upon it represent a primal or divine power of harmony and nature, and that the crest can aid them in restoring the sanctity of wild places.
