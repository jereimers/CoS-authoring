**Guarded Mind.** Spells and other effects can't read the infiltrator's thoughts or determine if the infiltrator is lying. Creatures can communicate telepathically with the infiltrator only if it allows such contact.

**Unarmored Defense.** While the infiltrator is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The infiltrator makes three Unarmed Strike attacks.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) force damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Cunning Action.** The infiltrator takes the Dash or Disengage action.


## Reactions

**Retaliating Strike.** When a creature within 5 feet of the infiltrator hits or misses the infiltrator with a melee attack, the infiltrator makes one Unarmed Strike attack against the attacker.
