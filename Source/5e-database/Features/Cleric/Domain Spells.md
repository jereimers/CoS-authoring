# Domain Spells

**Class:** [[Cleric]]  
**Level:** 9

Each domain has a list of spells--its domain spells--that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.
