# Spellfire Adept

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Fueled Spellfire

Once per turn, when a spell you cast deals Radiant damage, you can expend up to two [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]], roll them, and add the total rolled to one damage roll of the spell.

## Searing Spellfire

When you make a damage roll that deals Radiant damage, it ignores [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Radiant damage.
