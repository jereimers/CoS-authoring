# What It Is

Lake Baratok is a large body of water located west of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] in the wilderness of [[Barovia]].

# What the Party Knows

From [[Victor Vallakovich]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

## Khazan's Tower

The lake is home to [[Khazan]]'s wizard tower:

- The tower sits at the end of a gravel causeway that extends into the lake
- Khazan, an archmage, built the tower and imbued it with powerful enchantments
- Most notably, the tower features a protective anti-magic field that prevents other spellcasters from using magic within its influence
- This security measure makes the tower incredibly difficult to breach

## Location and Access

- Lake Baratok is located west of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]
- Victor doesn't know the exact route to reach it
- He recommends hiring [[Szoldar Szoldarovich]], a wolf hunter who knows the wilderness intimately
- Victor was forced by his father to accompany Szoldar on a hunting expedition last year "in an effort to make him more manly"
- Despite hating the experience, Victor came away impressed by Szoldar's wilderness skills and knowledge of the region

## Connection to Current Events

- A platinum ring bearing Khazan's sigil was found at the site where [[Arabelle]] was abducted
- Victor believes investigating the tower might provide clues about why Arabelle was taken
- The party has agreed to explore the tower and bring back any magical artifacts or tomes they find for Victor's research

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Raiding the Vallakovich Library (Politely)|Session 13]] — [[Victor Vallakovich]] told the party about [[Khazan]]'s tower on Lake Baratok and suggested they investigate it
