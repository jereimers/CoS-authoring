# Quaal's Feather Token, Whip

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This object looks like a feather.

You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes **1d6 + 5** Force damage.

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.
