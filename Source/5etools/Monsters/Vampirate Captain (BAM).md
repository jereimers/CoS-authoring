## Traits

**Explode.** When the captain is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a cloud of ash. Any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (**3d10**) necrotic damage.

**Spider Climb.** The captain can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Unusual Nature.** The captain doesn't require air or drink.


## Actions

**Energy Drain.** Attack (ms,rs) +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one creature. @h22 (**4d10**) necrotic damage. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies and instantly transforms into a free-willed shadow or vampirate (captain's choice) under the DM's control.

**Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d10 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Ship Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** A ship upon which the captain stands, along with all creatures and objects aboard it, becomes [[invisible]] to creatures not aboard the ship. The captain must concentrate on this magical effect to maintain it (as if [[concentration]] on a spell), and it lasts for up to 1 hour. The effect ends if the captain leaves the ship.



## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** The captain halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The captain must be able to see the attacker.
