# Q49. Beacon Tower Door

The parapet narrows to a width of ten feet, ending before a sturdy wooden door set into the wall of the eastern tower.

This door is barred from the inside. The phantom warriors in the tower's turrets (area Q52) make ranged attacks against characters who try to force their way into the tower. These spectral defenders have three-quarters cover behind the arrow slits.
