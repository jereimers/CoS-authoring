## Traits

**Amphibious.** Ayo can breathe air and water.

**Special Equipment.** Ayo wields a ruidium harpoon (see appendix B). If Ayo rolls a 1 on an attack roll made with the harpoon, she must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ayo makes three Harpoon or Longbow attacks.

**Ruidium Harpoon.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) psychic damage.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d8 + 5**) piercing damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Reposition.** Ayo issues orders to one ally she can see within 30 feet of herself. If the target can see or hear Ayo, it can spend its reaction to move up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
