## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the neogi's [[darkvision]].

**Mental Fortitude.** The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]], and magic can't put the neogi to sleep.

**Spider Climb.** The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The neogi makes one Bite attack and one Claw attack, or it makes two Tentacle of Hadar attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**2d4 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Tentacle of Hadar.** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) necrotic damage, and the target can't take reactions until the end of the neogi's next turn, as a spectral tentacle clings to the target.


## Bonus Actions

**Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The neogi targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[charmed]] by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The [[charmed]] target obeys the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 1 mile. Whenever the [[charmed]] target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
