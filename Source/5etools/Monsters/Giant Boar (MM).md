## Traits

**Charge.** If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (**2d6**) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the boar takes 10 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Tusk.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage.
