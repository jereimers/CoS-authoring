# Throne Card

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

As an action, you can speak a command word while holding this card to gain advantage on Charisma ([[Intimidation]] or [[Persuasion]]) checks for 1 minute. In addition, for that duration, you can use this card to cast the [[Command]] spell (save DC 17) as an action. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
