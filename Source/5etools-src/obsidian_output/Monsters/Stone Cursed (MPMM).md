## Traits

**Cunning Opportunist.** The stone cursed has advantage on the attack rolls of [[opportunity attack|]].

**False Appearance.** If the stone cursed is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the stone cursed move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the stone cursed isn't a statue.

**Unusual Nature.** The stone cursed doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Petrifying Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, or it begins to turn to stone and is [[restrained]] until the end of its next turn, when it must repeat the saving throw. The effect ends if the second save is successful; otherwise the target is [[petrified]] for 24 hours.
