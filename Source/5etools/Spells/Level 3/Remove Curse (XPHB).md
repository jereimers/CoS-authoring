# Remove Curse

*3rd-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's [[Attunement|XPHB]] to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
