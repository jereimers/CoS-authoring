# Snap-Trap Net

*Weapon (net), uncommon, consumable*

This reinforced net is woven from steel wire and enchanted sinew, designed to snap shut around a target with mechanical precision. Spring-loaded weights along the edges cause the net to constrict when it strikes, making escape significantly more difficult than with a standard net. [[The Grinch]] uses these to capture intruders and—occasionally—to snare particularly large prizes during his raids.

## Appearance

The net appears ordinary at first glance, but closer inspection reveals thin metal wires woven throughout the rope mesh. Small mechanical weights are attached at regular intervals along the edges, and a coiled spring mechanism is hidden in the throwing grip. The craftsmanship is rough but effective—clearly the work of a self-taught artificer.

## What the Party Knows

The party may find these nets in the Grinch's Workshop, encounter them as traps, or receive them as gifts if the Grinch is redeemed. A DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the spring mechanism; a DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the enchantment.

# Snap-Trap Net

## Description
A reinforced net woven with steel wire and enchanted to constrict on impact. Spring-loaded weights snap the net tight, and the magical weave resists cutting and tearing. The Grinch crafts these for both offense and defense—several are rigged as traps throughout his Workshop.

## Mechanics

### Properties

**Ranged Weapon (Net)**
- **Range:** 20/60 ft.
- **Special:** A Large or smaller creature hit by the net is restrained until freed.

**Enhanced Restraint:** Unlike a standard net, escaping a Snap-Trap Net requires:
- A successful DC 14 Strength check (action) to break free, OR
- A successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools (action) to disable the mechanism, OR
- Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net (AC 10, immune to bludgeoning and piercing)

**Spring-Loaded:** This net does not suffer disadvantage when used to make a ranged attack, unlike a standard net.

**Constricting Weave:** At the start of each of the restrained creature's turns, it takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage as the net tightens. A creature can use its reaction to hold the net open, negating this damage until the start of its next turn.

### Consumable
After use, a Snap-Trap Net becomes a standard net unless retrieved intact. The spring mechanism can be reset with a DC 14 Intelligence (Tinker's Tools) check and 10 minutes of work.

### Using as a Trap
The Snap-Trap Net can be rigged as a trap:
- **Setup:** 1 minute to set, requiring a DC 14 Intelligence (Tinker's Tools) check
- **Trigger:** Pressure plate, tripwire, or similar (choose during setup)
- **Detection:** DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) to notice; DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) to identify
- **Effect:** First creature to trigger the trap must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity save or be restrained

## Lore Flavor

The Grinch developed these nets over years of trial and error. The first versions were simple rope snares; the current design incorporates salvaged clockwork, enchanted wire, and hard-won lessons about what makes a good trap. He considers them among his finest creations—practical, reliable, and deeply satisfying to use on unwanted guests.

Max was caught in an early prototype once. The Grinch has since calibrated them to ignore anything under 30 pounds.

## Balance Notes

**Intended Level:** 3+

**Power Assessment:** Strong utility item, balanced by consumable nature
- Superior to a standard net in every way, but limited availability
- The constricting damage adds pressure but isn't overwhelming
- Trap functionality adds versatility
- Consumable unless repaired, preventing stockpiling

**Value:** ~75 gp if sold (the mechanism is intricate and valuable)

**Comparison:** Roughly equivalent to a *+1 Net* with added utility

## Alternate Versions

### Basic: Crude Snap-Trap
*Weapon (net), common, consumable*

An earlier version of the Grinch's design, less refined:
- DC 12 to escape (Strength) or disable (thieves' tools)
- No constricting damage
- Still suffers disadvantage on ranged attacks like a standard net
- Cannot be reset after use

### Cursed: Jealous Net
*Weapon (net), uncommon (cursed), consumable*

A net imbued with the Grinch's bitterness:
- Functions as a standard Snap-Trap Net
- **Curse:** If the net successfully restrains a creature that appears happy or is celebrating, the net's wielder must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom save or become compelled to leave the restrained creature in the net and take one of their possessions as a "prize."
- The curse can be identified with *Identify* or a DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) check

### Improved: Artificer's Masterwork Net
*Weapon (net), rare, consumable*

The Grinch's finest creation, perhaps gifted to the party if redeemed:
- **Range:** 30/90 ft.
- DC 16 to escape or disable
- Deals 2d4 bludgeoning damage per turn
- **Entangling:** When a creature is restrained by this net, it also cannot speak or perform somatic components for spells
- **Self-Resetting:** Automatically resets after 1 minute, usable again without repair
- The net has 25 HP and AC 12

## Notes
- The Snap-Trap Net is designed as a tactical tool that rewards creative use
- Multiple nets can shift combat encounters significantly—consider limiting availability
- The trap functionality makes these excellent for dungeon preparation
- The Grinch has approximately 1d4 of these in his Workshop at any given time
