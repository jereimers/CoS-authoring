# Biza's Breath

*Item, None*

A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The [[poisoned]] creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no other creature within its reach, the [[poisoned]] creature does nothing on its turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
