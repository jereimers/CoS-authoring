## Traits

**Dark Devotion.** Thalamra has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]].

**Devil's Sight.** Thalamra can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, out to a distance of 120 feet.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Thalamra uses eldritch blast twice or makes two unarmed strikes.

**Eldritch Blast (Cantrip).** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) force damage.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 bludgeoning damage.



## Reactions

**Hellish Rebuke (1st-Level Spell; 2/Day).** When Thalamra is damaged by a creature within 60 feet of her that she can see, the creature that damaged her is engulfed in hellish flames and must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (**3d10**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
