---

**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from you to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into a fiery explosion. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **8d6** Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start [[burning|XPHB]].

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `8d6` for each spell slot level above 3.
