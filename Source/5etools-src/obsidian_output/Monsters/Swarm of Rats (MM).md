## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The swarm has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny rat. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. @h7 (**2d6**) piercing damage, or 3 (**1d6**) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
