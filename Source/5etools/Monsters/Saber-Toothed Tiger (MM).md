## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The tiger has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Pounce.** If the tiger moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is [[prone]], the tiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage.
