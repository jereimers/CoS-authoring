# Chef

Time spent mastering the culinary arts has paid off, granting you the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency with [[cook's utensils|phb]] if you don't already have it.
- As part of a short rest, you can cook special food, provided you have ingredients and [[cook's utensils|phb]] on hand. You can prepare enough of this food for a number of creatures equal to 4 + your proficiency bonus. At the end of the short rest, any creature who eats the food and spends one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points regains an extra `1d8` hit points.
- With one hour of work or when you finish a long rest, you can cook a number of treats equal to your proficiency bonus. These special treats last 8 hours after being made. A creature can use a bonus action to eat one of those treats to gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.
