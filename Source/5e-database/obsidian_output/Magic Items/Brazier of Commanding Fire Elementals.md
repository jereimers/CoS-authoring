# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals

*Wondrous Items, Rare*

Wondrous item, rare

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
