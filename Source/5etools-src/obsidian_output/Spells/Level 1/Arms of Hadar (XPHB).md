Invoking Hadar, you cause tendrils to erupt from yourself. Each creature in a 10-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes **2d6** Necrotic damage and can't take Reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `2d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
