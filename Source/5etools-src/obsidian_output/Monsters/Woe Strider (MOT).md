## Traits

**Antimagic Cone.** The woe strider's open mouth creates an area of antimagic, as in the [[antimagic field]] spell, in a 60-foot cone. At the start of each of its turns, the woe strider decides which way the cone faces and whether its mouth is open or closed.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The woe strider makes two claw attacks and one bite attack. If both claws hit the same creature, the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14).

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) slashing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) psychic damage.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature that is [[grappled]], [[incapacitated]], or [[restrained]]. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) piercing damage plus 16 (**3d10**) psychic damage. In addition, each magic item the creature is carrying that isn't an artifact has its magical properties suppressed for 1 minute.
