## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sorrowful Presence.** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[charmed]] by the eladrin for 1 minute. While [[charmed]] in this way, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. The [[charmed]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Sorrowful Presence for the next 24 hours.

Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [[charmed]] creature, the [[charmed]] creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The eladrin makes two Longsword or Longbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d8**) slashing damage, or 5 (**1d10**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 13 (**3d8**) cold damage.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) cold damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Fey Step {@recharge 4}.** The eladrin teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.


## Reactions

**Frigid Rebuke.** When the eladrin takes damage from a creature the eladrin can see within 60 feet of it, the eladrin can force that creature to make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 11 (**2d10**) cold damage.
