## Traits

**Cacophony of Minds.** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the intellect snare must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[incapacitated]] condition for 1 minute. An [[incapacitated]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this intellect snare's Cacophony of Minds for 24 hours.

**Magic Resistance.** The intellect snare has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The intellect snare makes two Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) force damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 17).


## Bonus Actions

**Siphon Thoughts.** The intellect snare targets one creature it is grappling. The target must make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw, taking 21 (**6d6**) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The intellect snare then regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage taken.
