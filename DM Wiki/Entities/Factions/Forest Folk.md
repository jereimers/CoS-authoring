# Who They Are

The Forest Folk are the original inhabitants of the valley now called [[Barovia]]. They are a mysterious group whose ways remain largely unknown to outsiders.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

## Origins and Beliefs

- The Forest Folk were the original inhabitants of the valley, living here long before it was called Barovia
- They worship [[Source/CoS-Reloaded/Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]] as a god
- Their ways and practices are mysterious to most Barovians
- Little is known about their culture or beliefs beyond their devotion to Strahd

## Gathering Place

- The Forest Folk are said to gather at [[Yester Hill]], an ancient site in the wilderness
- Yester Hill appears to be significant to their religious practices or community

## Connection to Recent Events

- Ireena mentioned the Forest Folk after the party fought [[Twig Blights]] and [[Scarecrows]] at the [[Luna River Crossroads]]
- The context suggests these plant creatures may be connected to the Forest Folk's activities or beliefs
- The exact nature of this connection remains unclear

# Significance

The Forest Folk represent a shadowy presence in Barovia—an ancient people who venerate the very vampire lord that terrorizes the valley's other inhabitants. Their worship of Strahd and mysterious gatherings at Yester Hill suggest they may play a role in the dark powers that grip the land.

# Where We've Seen Them

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#CSI Luna River|Session 13]] — Ireena mentioned them after the battle with twig blights and scarecrows
