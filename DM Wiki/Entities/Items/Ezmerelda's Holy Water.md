# Ezmerelda's Holy Water

## Description
[[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]] carries **six vials of holy water** as part of her vampire-hunting supplies. Holy water is a blessed substance that is particularly effective against undead and fiends, making it an essential tool for any who hunt creatures of darkness.

## Properties

## Usage
As an action, you can splash the contents of a flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon.

If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
