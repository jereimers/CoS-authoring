*6th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (an opal worth 1,000 GP+)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

Six chromatic spheres orbit you for the duration.

While the spheres are present, you can expend spheres to create the following effects:

- **Absorb Energy:** When you take Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to expend one sphere and give yourself [[Resistance|XPHB]] to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn.
- **Energy Blast:** As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you send one sphere hurtling toward a target within 120 feet of yourself. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes **3d6** Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (your choice). Regardless of whether you hit, the sphere is expended.

The spell ends early if you have no more spheres remaining.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The number of spheres increases by 1 for every spell slot level above 6.
