## Traits

**Amphibious.** The kraken can breathe air and water.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day, or 5/Day in Lair).** If the kraken fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Siege Monster.** The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kraken makes two Tentacle attacks and uses Fling, Lightning Strike, or Swallow.

**Tentacle.** m +17, reach 30 ft. @h24 (**4d6 + 10**) Bludgeoning damage. The target has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 20) from one of ten tentacles, and it has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the grapple ends.

**Fling.** The kraken throws a Large or smaller creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by it to a space it can see within 60 feet of itself that isn't in the air. dex DC 25, the creature thrown and each creature in the destination space. @actSaveFail 18 (**4d8**) Bludgeoning damage, and the target has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.

**Lightning Strike.** dex DC 23, one creature the kraken can see within 120 feet. @actSaveFail 33 (**6d10**) Lightning damage. @actSaveSuccess Half damage.

**Swallow.** dex DC 25, one creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by the kraken (it can have up to four creatures swallowed at a time). @actSaveFail 23 (**3d8 + 10**) Piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is swallowed and no longer [[Grappled|XPHB]]. A swallowed creature has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition, has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and takes 24 (**7d6**) Acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which falls in a space within 10 feet of the kraken with the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. If the kraken dies, any swallowed creature no longer has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting [[Prone|XPHB]].




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Storm Bolt.** The kraken uses Lightning Strike.

**Toxic Ink.** con DC 23, each creature in a 15-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the kraken while it is underwater. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Poisoned|XPHB]] conditions until the end of the kraken's next turn.
