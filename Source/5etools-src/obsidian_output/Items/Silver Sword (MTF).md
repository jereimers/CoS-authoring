# Silver Sword

*Item, Unknown (Magic)* *(requires attunement by a creature that has psionic ability)*

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [[astral projection]] spell), you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
