# Goggles of Object Reading

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

These leather-framed goggles feature purple crystal lenses. While wearing the goggles, you have advantage on Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) checks made to reveal information about a creature or object you can see.

In addition, you can cast the [[identify]] spell using the googles. Once you do so, you can't do so again until the next dawn.
