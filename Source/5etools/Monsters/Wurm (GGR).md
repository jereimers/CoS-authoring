## Traits

**Siege Monster.** The wurm deals double damage to objects and structures.

**Earth Tremors.** The wurm creates earth tremors as it moves overland or underground. Any creature that comes within 30 feet of the moving wurm for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) bludgeoning damage and fall [[prone]]. Any structure or object anchored to the ground that comes within 30 feet of the moving wurm for the first time on a turn takes 10 (**3d6**) force damage.

**Tunneler.** The wurm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h24 (**5d6 + 7**) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the wurm. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the wurm, and takes 17 (**5d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the wurm's turns. If the wurm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the wurm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the wurm. If the wurm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
