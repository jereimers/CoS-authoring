## Traits

**Labyrinthine Recall.** Baphomet can perfectly recall any path he has traveled, and he is immune to the [[maze]] spell.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Baphomet fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Baphomet has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Baphomet makes one Bite attack, one Gore attack, and one Heartcleaver attack. He also uses Frightful Presence.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d8 + 10**) piercing damage.

**Gore.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d6 + 10**) piercing damage. If Baphomet moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 16 (**3d10**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked [[prone]].

**Heartcleaver.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h21 (**2d10 + 10**) force damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Baphomet's choice within 120 feet of him and aware of him must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. These later saves have disadvantage if Baphomet is within line of sight of the creature.

If a creature succeeds on any of these saves or the effect ends on it, the creature is immune to Baphomet's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Heartcleaver Attack.** Baphomet makes one Heartcleaver attack.

**Charge (Costs 2 Actions).** Baphomet moves up to his speed without provoking [[opportunity attack|]], then makes a Gore attack.
