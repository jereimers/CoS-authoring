## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe both air and water.

**Fabricate (1/Day).** The dragon can cast [[fabricate]], requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) necrotic damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 35 (**10d6**) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.


## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The dragon magically transforms into any creature that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.

**Psychic Step.** The dragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Claw.** The dragon makes one Claw attack.

**Psionics (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon uses Psychic Step or Spellcasting.

**Essential Reduction (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon targets a creature or an object not being worn or carried that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (**8d6**) necrotic damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it crumbles to dust.
