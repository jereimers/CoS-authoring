## Actions

**Multiattack.** The inquisitive makes three Crooked Staff attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Inquisitive Eye.

**Crooked Staff.** m +4, reach 5 ft. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. If the target already has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition, the attack deals an extra 7 (**2d6**) Radiant damage.

**Inquisitive Eye.** wis DC 13, one creature the inquisitive can see within 60 feet. @actSaveFail 10 (**3d6**) Psychic damage, and the target is marked. The inquisitive has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against a target it has marked. While marked, the target can't become hidden from the inquisitive, and if it has the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition, it gains no benefit from that condition against the inquisitive. The mark disappears after 1 minute or when the inquisitive uses this action again. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.



## Reactions

**Spontaneous Barrier {@recharge 4}.** @actTrigger The inquisitive or an ally it can see is hit with an attack roll. @actResponse The inquisitive adds 2 to its or the ally's AC against that attack, possibly causing it to miss.
