# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a [[water elemental]], as if you had cast the [[conjure elemental]] spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
