# Moorbounder

*Item, None*

Beasts of burden are common throughout Xhorhas, and often horses and other riding animals are the best or only option. For those who require speed and have a little more coin to spend, the best option is often a moorbounder. However, moorbounders that haven't undergone proper training or established bonds of trust with their masters tend to attack and even eat their riders.

Moorbounders can cost anywhere from 300 to 500 gp each. They're often cheaper and more abundant in towns on the wastes than in cities like Rosohna.
