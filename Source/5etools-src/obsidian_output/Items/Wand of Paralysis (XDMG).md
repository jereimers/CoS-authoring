# Wand of Paralysis

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to expend 1 charge to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
