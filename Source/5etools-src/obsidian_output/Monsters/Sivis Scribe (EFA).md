## Traits

**Words of Reason.** Allies in a 10-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the scribe have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws to avoid or end the [[Charmed|XPHB]] or [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition. This trait doesn't function if the scribe has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The scribe makes two Bursting Sigil attacks.

**Bursting Sigil.** m,r +5, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) Radiant damage.



## Reactions

**Word of Stasis {@recharge 5}.** con DC 13, each creature in a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point the scribe can see within 60 feet. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition until the start of the scribe's next turn. While the target is [[Incapacitated|XPHB]], its [[Speed|XPHB]] is 0 and can't increase.
