# Ring of Temporal Salvation

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

If you die while wearing this gray crystal ring, you vanish and reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the space you left (or the nearest unoccupied space). You have a number of hit points equal to `3d6` + your Constitution modifier. If your hit point maximum is lower than the number of hit points you regain, your hit point maximum rises to a similar amount. If you have any levels of [[exhaustion]], reduce your level of [[exhaustion]] by 1. Once the ring is used, it turns to dust and is destroyed.
