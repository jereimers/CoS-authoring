## Traits

**Axiomatic Mind.** The decaton can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Combat Ready.** The decaton has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Disintegration.** If the decaton dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind anything it was carrying.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The decaton makes three Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the decaton can't use this tentacle against other targets. The decaton has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Lightning Rays {@recharge}.** The decaton unleashes a barrage of lightning bolts from its eyes. Each creature within 30 feet of the decaton must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 (**7d10**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.
