## Traits

**Unarmored Defense.** While Steel Crane is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, his AC includes his Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Steel Crane makes three attacks.

**Force Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) force damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the start of Steel Crane's next turn.

**Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) slashing damage or, if the target is a creature, Steel Crane can grapple the target instead (escape DC 15). Steel Crane can't make attacks with the whip while using it to grapple a creature. Anytime on his turn, he can release a creature [[grappled]] by the whip (no action required).

**Heal Self (Recharges after a Long Rest).** Steel Crane regains `2d8 + 4` hit points, and all levels of [[exhaustion]] end on him.



## Reactions

**Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, Steel Crane deflects the missile. The damage he takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 10`. If the damage is reduced to 0, Steel Crane catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and Steel Crane has a hand free.

**Slow Descent (3/Day).** When Steel Crane falls, he can slow his descent, taking no damage from the fall.
