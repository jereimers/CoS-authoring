# Genie Magic

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Wish Magic

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can cast a level 1 spell of your choice from the Sorcerer spell list that has a casting time of an action. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. The spell's spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

When you reach level 11, the spell you cast with this feat is cast as though using a level 2 spell slot.

When you reach level 17, the spell is cast as though using a level 3 spell slot.
