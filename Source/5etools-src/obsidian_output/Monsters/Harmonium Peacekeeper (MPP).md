## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** The peacekeeper has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the peacekeeper's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition.


## Actions

**Electrified Mancatcher.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) lightning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 13). Until the [[grappled]] condition ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition and can't teleport, the peacekeeper can't make Electrified Mancatcher attacks, and the target takes 8 (**1d10 + 3**) lightning damage at the start of each of its turns.
