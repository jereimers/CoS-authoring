# Prismatic Spray

*7th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (60-feet cone)  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature in the [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll `1d8` to determine which color ray affects it, consulting the Prismatic Rays table.

**Prismatic Rays**

| 1d8 | Ray |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Red.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** Fire damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 2 | **Orange.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** Acid damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 3 | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** Lightning damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 4 | **Green.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** Poison damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 5 | **Blue.** *Failed Save:* **12d6** Cold damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 6 | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the [[Petrified|XPHB]] condition until it is freed by an effect like the [[Greater Restoration|XPHB]] spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. |
| 7 | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice). |
| 8 | **Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any 8. |
