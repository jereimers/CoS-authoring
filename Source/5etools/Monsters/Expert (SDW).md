## Traits

**Helpful.** The expert can take the Help action as a bonus action, and the creature who receives the help gains a `1d6` bonus to the `d20` roll. If that roll is an attack roll, the creature can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the attack's damage roll against one target.

**Evasion.** When the expert is not [[incapacitated]] and subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it failed.

**Tools.** The expert has thieves' tools and a musical instrument.


## Actions

**Extra Attack.** The expert can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the attack action on its turn.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage.
