# Propeller Helm

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement by a small humanoid)*

While worn, the helm allows its wearer to use an action to cast the [[levitate]] spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a 50% chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.
