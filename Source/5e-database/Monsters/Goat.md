## Special Abilities

**Charge.** If the goat moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Sure-Footed.** The goat has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.


## Actions

**Ram.** Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.
