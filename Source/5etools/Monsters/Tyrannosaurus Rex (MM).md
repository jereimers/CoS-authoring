## Actions

**Multiattack.** The tyrannosaurus makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h33 (**4d12 + 7**) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the tyrannosaurus can't bite another target.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) bludgeoning damage.
