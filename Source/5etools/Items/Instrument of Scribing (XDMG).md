# Instrument of Scribing

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This [[musical instrument|XPHB]] has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While you are playing it, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to expend 1 charge and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a Bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical [[Darkness|XPHB]]. Casting the [[Dispel Magic|XPHB]] spell on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.
