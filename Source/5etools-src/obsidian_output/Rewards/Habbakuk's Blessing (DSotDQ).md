# Habbakuk's Blessing

*Charm*

Habbakuk blesses your travels through the Northern Wastes. This charm grants you advantage on Wisdom ([[Survival]]) checks made to notice the Wash's waters filling chasms.

Additionally, while traveling, you and up to 5 other creatures with you ignore [[difficult terrain|PHB]] outdoors in the Northern Wastes, allowing you to move at double the pace listed on the Northern Wastes Land Travel table (see the "[[Into the Wastes|DSotDQ]]" section earlier in this chapter).

This charm vanishes 24 hours after you leave the Northern Wastes.
