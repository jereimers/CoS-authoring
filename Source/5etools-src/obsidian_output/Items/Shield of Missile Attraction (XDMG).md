# Shield of Missile Attraction

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

While holding this Shield, you have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.

## Curse

This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a [[Remove Curse|XPHB]] spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
