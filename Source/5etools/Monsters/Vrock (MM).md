## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The vrock has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

**Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Spores {@recharge}.** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]]. While [[poisoned]] in this way, a target takes 5 (**1d10**) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

**Stunning Screech (1/Day).** The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of the vrock's next turn.
