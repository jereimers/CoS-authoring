# +3 Moon Sickle

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*

This silver-bladed sickle glimmers softly with moonlight. While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your druid and ranger spells. In addition, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the sickle.
