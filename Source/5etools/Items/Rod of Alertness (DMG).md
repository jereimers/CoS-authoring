# Rod of Alertness

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.

## Alertness

While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks and on rolls for initiative.

## Spells

While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [[detect evil and good]], [[detect magic]], [[detect poison and disease]], or [[see invisibility]].

## Protective Aura

As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any [[invisible]] hostile creature that is also in the bright light.

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
