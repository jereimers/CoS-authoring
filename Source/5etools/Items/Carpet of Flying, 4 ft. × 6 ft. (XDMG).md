# Carpet of Flying, 4 ft. × 6 ft.

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare*

You can make this carpet hover and fly by taking a [[Magic|XPHB]] action and using the carpet's command word. It moves according to your directions if you are within 30 feet of it.

A 4 ft. × 6 ft. carpet can carry up to 400 lb. at a fly speed of 60 feet. A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but its [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] is halved if it carries more than its normal capacity.
