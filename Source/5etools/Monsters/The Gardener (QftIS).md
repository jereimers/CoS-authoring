## Traits

**Fey Rebirth.** If the Gardener dies in the Eternal Garden, they revive with all their hit points `1d4` days later in a safe location within the garden.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the Gardener fails a saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead.

**Unfettered Steps.** The Gardener is unaffected by difficult terrain.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Gardener makes two Vine attacks and can use Breath of Tranquility if available.

**Vine.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d12 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (**2d8**) psychic damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, the vine wraps around the target, and the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 17). The vine vanishes when the target is no longer [[grappled]], or when the Gardener wills it to (no action required). A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the vine has the [[unconscious]] condition but is stable instead of dying.

**Breath of Tranquility {@recharge 5}.** The Gardener exhales soporific vapor in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition. A [[poisoned]] creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a failed save, it has the [[unconscious]] condition, and on a successful save, the effect ends on it. An [[unconscious]] creature is no longer [[poisoned]] and remains [[unconscious]] for 1 hour, until it takes damage, or until a creature uses an action to shake it awake.



## Reactions

**Pacification.** When a creature within 120 feet of the Gardener damages the Gardener, that creature takes 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage, and the Gardener teleports, along with anything they are wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space they can see within 15 feet. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the psychic damage has the [[unconscious]] condition and is stable instead of dying.

**Spell Refuge.** When the Gardener or a creature within 30 feet of the Gardener takes damage from a spell, the Gardener chooses up to 5 creatures within 30 feet of themself. The Gardener and the chosen creatures have resistance to all damage from the triggering spell.
