# Witchbriars

Some Low Netherese witches can enchant a patch of thorns to lash out at passersby. These enchanted thorn patches, called witchbriars, are often meant to ensnare Netherese mages who mistreat their workers, though witchbriars don't discriminate once they're animated. Witchbriars resemble an ordinary patch or hedge of thorny vines.

A patch of witchbriars occupies a 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] and has AC 11; HP 30; and Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage. When a creature casts a spell using a spell slot within 10 feet of witchbriars, thorny vines reach out to entwine the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or have the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 14). Druids automatically succeed on this saving throw. While the target is Grappled in this way, it has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and takes 11 (`2d10`) Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. One patch of witchbriars can grapple up to four creatures at a time.

Any amount of Fire damage destroys a patch of witchbriars instantly.
