# Horn of Valhalla, Brass

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the [[Berserker|XMM]] stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [[Immunity|XPHB]] to the [[Charmed|XPHB]] and [[Frightened|XPHB]] conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A brass horn summons 3 [[Berserker|XMM]]. To use the brass horn, you must have [[Proficiency|XPHB]] with all Simple weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [[Berserker|XMM]] attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [[Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB]] to you and your allies and follow your commands.
