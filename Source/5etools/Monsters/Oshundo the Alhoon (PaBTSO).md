## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** Oshundo has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Oshundo makes two Chilling Grasp or Arcane Bolt attacks.

**Chilling Grasp.** Melee Spell Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**4d6**) cold damage, and Oshundo regains 14 hit points if the target is a creature.

**Arcane Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h28 (**8d6**) force damage.

**Thundering Blast {@recharge 5}.** Oshundo emits a wave of domineering energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (**4d8 + 4**) thunder damage and have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.



## Reactions

**Negate Spell (3/Day).** Oshundo targets one creature it can perceive within 60 feet of itself that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, the spell fails, but any spell slots or charges aren't wasted.
