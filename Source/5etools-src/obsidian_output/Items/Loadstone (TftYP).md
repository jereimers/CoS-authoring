# Loadstone

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This stone is a large gem worth 150 gp.

## Curse

The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is hidden; [[detect magic]] doesn't detect it. An [[identify]] spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the [[Dash]] or [[Disengage]] action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with [[remove curse]] or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone.
