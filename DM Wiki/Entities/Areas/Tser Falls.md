%%
 an area is a location, place, region, etc. It can be as large as the Planes of Existence and as small as a room inside a building inside a town inside a region inside a domain inside a continent/plane. Areas have types, are encountered by the party at a particular time/place, and can be home to multiple NPCs, items, etc. %%
# Overview

You follow the [[Old Svalich Road|dirt road]] as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of mold-encrusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog-shrouded pines that blanket the valley.
