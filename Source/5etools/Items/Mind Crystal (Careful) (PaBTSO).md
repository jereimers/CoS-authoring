# Mind Crystal (Careful)

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This gemstone contains a crystallized bit of spellcasting magic.

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action while holding the mind crystal, you can modify the spell in the way described below. You can use only a single mind crystal to modify the spell, and you can't use a mind crystal and a Metamagic option on the same spell. Once you use the mind crystal, it becomes a nonmagical gem worth 50 gp.

## Modify Spell

Choose up to three creatures affected by the spell. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell.
