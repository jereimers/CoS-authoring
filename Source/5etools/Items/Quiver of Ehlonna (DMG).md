# Quiver of Ehlonna

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty [[arrow|phb]], [[crossbow bolt|phb]], or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen [[javelin|phb]] or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, [[quarterstaff|phb]], or [[spear|phb]].

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
