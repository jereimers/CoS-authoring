## Traits

**Unarmored Defense.** While the high curator is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The high curator makes three Force Strike attacks and uses Brain Burn (if available).

**Force Strike.** Attack (ms,rs) +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) force damage.

**Brain Burn {@recharge 4}.** The high curator targets up to two creatures it can see within 30 feet of itself. Each target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target takes 28 (**8d6**) psychic damage and can't take reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.
