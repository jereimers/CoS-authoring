# Gunpowder (powder horn)

*Item, None*

Setting fire to a powder horn full of Gunpowder causes it to explode. When a powder horn explodes, each creature in a 10-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on the powder horn makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
