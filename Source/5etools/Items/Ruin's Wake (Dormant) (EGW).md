# Ruin's Wake (Dormant)

*Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement)*

This spear is made from the ivory bone of an ancient gold dragon and carved with an Orc hymn to Gruumsh.

## Sentience

Ruin's Wake is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 22. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Orc.

## Personality

A slaughter-loving [[balor]] named Yarrowish lives within Ruin's Wake. The weapon desires only to draw blood and pushes its wielder to solve problems with violence.

## Dormant

The spear grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Orc.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra **1d8** piercing damage to any target it hits. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it flies back to your hand.
- As a reaction when you are hit by a melee attack, you can make a melee attack with Ruin's Wake with advantage against the attacker. You can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest.

> **Betrayer Artifact Properties**
> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property and one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property and an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.
