## Actions

**Multiattack.** The liondrake makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Blood-Chilling Roar {@recharge 4}.** The liondrake lets out a terrifying roar audible out to 300 feet. Any creature within 30 feet of the liondrake that can hear its roar must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the liondrake for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is also [[paralyzed]] for the same duration. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this liondrake's Blood-Chilling Roar for the next 24 hours.
