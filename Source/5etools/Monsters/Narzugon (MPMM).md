## Traits

**Infernal Tack.** The narzugon wears spurs that are part of [[infernal tack|MTF]], which allow it to summon its [[nightmare]] companion as an action.

**Magic Resistance.** The narzugon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The narzugon makes three Hellfire Lance attacks. It also uses Infernal Command or Terrifying Command.

**Hellfire Lance.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d12 + 5**) piercing damage plus 16 (**3d10**) fire damage. If this damage kills a creature with a soul, the soul rises from the River Styx as a [[lemure]] in Avernus in `1d4` hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a [[wish]] spell or killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.

**Infernal Command.** Each ally of the narzugon within 60 feet of it can't be [[charmed]] or [[frightened]] until the end of the narzugon's next turn.

**Terrifying Command.** Each creature within 60 feet of the narzugon that isn't a Fiend must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or become [[frightened]] of the narzugon for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that makes a successful saving throw is immune to this narzugon's Terrifying Command for 24 hours.

**Healing (1/Day).** The narzugon, or one creature it touches, regains 100 hit points.
