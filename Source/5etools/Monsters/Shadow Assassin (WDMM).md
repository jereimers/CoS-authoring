## Traits

**Amorphous.** The assassin can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the assassin can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Sunlight Weakness.** While in sunlight, the assassin has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The assassin makes two Shadow Blade attacks.

**Shadow Blade.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage. Unless the target is immune to necrotic damage, the target's Strength score is reduced by `1d4` each time it is hit by this attack. The target dies if its Strength is reduced to 0. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a shadow (see the Monster Manual) rises from the corpse `1d4` hours later.
