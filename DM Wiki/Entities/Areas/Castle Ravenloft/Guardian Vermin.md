# K35. Guardian Vermin

<div class="description"><p>A door of delicately engraved steel stands at the west end of this short, dark hallway. Intricate details stand out clearly on the door's surface. The door seems to shine with a light of its own, untouched by time. Flanking the door are two alcoves in shadow. A dark, vaguely man-shaped figure stands in each alcove.</p></div>

The dark figures are four swarms of rats piled atop one another to form manlike shapes (two swarms per alcove). These rats are under Strahd's control and attack anyone that tries to move through this area.

The steel door is engraved with images of a human king in armor astride a horse, a majestic range of mountains and shooting stars in the background. Tiny figures of people and wolves frame the image.
