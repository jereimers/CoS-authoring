# Needler Pistol

*Item, None*

This strange pistol resembles a flask with a honeycomb of tubes sticking out its front. The weapon is powered by an [[energy cell]] stored at the base of the flask. Placing a full [[energy cell]] in the pistol gives the pistol 10 charges.

As an action while holding this pistol, you can expend 1 of its charges to fire a burst of glowing, needlelike darts from the pistol in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking **8d4** piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Replacing the Energy Cell

While the pistol has charges remaining, its [[energy cell]] can't be removed. Once the pistol has 0 charges, you can replace the [[energy cell]] with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.
