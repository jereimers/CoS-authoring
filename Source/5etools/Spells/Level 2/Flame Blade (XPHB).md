---

**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a sumac leaf)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]].

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to **3d6** plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

The flaming blade sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 10-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 10 feet.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 2.
