# Rally

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can expend one Superiority Die to bolster the resolve of a companion. Choose an ally of yours within 30 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the Superiority Die roll plus half your Fighter level (round down).
