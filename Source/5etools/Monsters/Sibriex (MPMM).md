## Traits

**Contamination.** The sibriex emits an aura of corruption 30 feet in every direction. Vegetation withers in the aura, and the ground in the aura is difficult terrain for other creatures. Any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) poison damage. A creature that succeeds on the save is immune to this sibriex's Contamination for 24 hours.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the sibriex fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The sibriex has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The sibriex makes three Chain attacks, and it uses Squirt Bile.

**Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h20 (**2d12 + 7**) force damage.

**Squirt Bile.** The sibriex targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 31 (**9d6**) acid damage.

**Warp Creature.** The sibriex targets up to three creatures it can see within 120 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature becomes immune to this sibriex's Warp Creature. On a failed save, the target is [[poisoned]], which causes it to also gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. Three successful saves against the poison end it, and ending the poison removes any levels of [[exhaustion]] caused by it. Each failed save causes the target to gain another level of [[exhaustion]]. Once the target reaches 6 levels of [[exhaustion]], it dies and instantly transforms into a living [[manes]] under the sibriex's control. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a [[wish]] spell.

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Cast a Spell.** The sibriex uses Spellcasting.

**Spray Bile.** The sibriex uses Squirt Bile.

**Warp (Costs 2 Actions).** The sibriex uses Warp Creature.
