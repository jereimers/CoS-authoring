**Range:** Self (15-feet cone)  
**Components:** V, S

A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from you. Each creature in a 15-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d6** Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] that aren't being worn or carried start [[burning|XPHB]].

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
