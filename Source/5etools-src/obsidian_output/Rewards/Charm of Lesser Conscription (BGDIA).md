# Charm of Lesser Conscription

*Charm*

While you have this charm, you attract flies. As an action, you activate this charm to summon a [[barbed devil]], two [[Bearded Devil|]], or three [[Spined Devil|]]. All devils appear at once in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of you. Each devil obeys your commands and serves you eagerly for 9 days or until it dies, whereupon the devil disappears. Once all devils summoned by this charm disappear, the charm vanishes from you.
