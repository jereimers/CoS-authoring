# Hat of Vortexes

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

This hat has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action and expend 1 charge while holding the hat to release a magical vortex from it. The vortex fills a 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you and lasts for 1 hour. While the vortex is present, its area is [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]].

You decide a vortex's visual details when you create it. For instance, the vortex might be multicolored or glittery.
