# Robe of Scintillating Colors

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This robe has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see you have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against you. Any creature in the [[Bright Light|XPHB]] that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Stunned|XPHB]] condition until the effect ends.
