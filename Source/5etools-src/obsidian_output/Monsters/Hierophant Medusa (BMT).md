## Traits

**Devotion's Call (1/Day).** The medusa can cast the [[Resurrection]] spell, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If the medusa fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The medusa makes one Constrict attack, one Final Blade attack, and one Snake Hair attack. Alternatively, it makes two Wrathful Strike attacks.

**Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition, and the medusa can't constrict another creature.

**Final Blade.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) slashing damage plus 21 (**6d6**) force damage. If the target has at least one head and the medusa rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it fails a DC 20 Constitution saving throw and can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 28 (**8d6**) force damage from the hit.

**Snake Hair.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d10 + 6**) piercing damage plus 5 (**1d10**) poison damage.

**Wrathful Strike.** Ranged Spell Attack +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) radiant damage, and the target has the [[blinded]] condition until the end of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Petrifying Gaze {@recharge 4}.** The medusa unleashes petrifying magic from its eyes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw if it doesn't have the [[blinded]] condition. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature has the [[petrified]] condition. Otherwise, on a failed save, the creature takes 10 (**3d6**) force damage, begins to turn to stone, and has the [[restrained]] condition. The [[restrained]] creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a failed save, it has the [[petrified]] condition, and on a successful save, the effect ends on it. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the [[Greater Restoration]] spell or other magic.

A creature can use its reaction, if available, to shut its eyes to avoid the saving throw. If the creature does so, it has the [[blinded]] condition until the end of its next turn.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Move.** The medusa moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Wrathful Blast (Costs 2 Actions).** The medusa makes one Wrathful Strike attack.

**Final Slash (Costs 3 Actions).** The medusa makes one Final Blade attack with advantage.
