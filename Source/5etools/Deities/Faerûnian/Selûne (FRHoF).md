# Selûne

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Selûne is a god of the moon, and she is among the most ancient of Faerûn's deities. People in Faerûn consider the moon to literally be the god gazing down on the world, and the trailing motes of light behind it her tears. She is also a god of stars, navigation, and motherhood.

Selûne appears as a woman of varying ages. She sometimes changes slowly before an onlooker's gaze, passing through the phases of aging as the moon transitions through its cycle. In any form, she emits the silvery-blue glow of the brightest full moon. When she sends an emissary to mortals, she sends an [[Owl|XMM]] or other night bird, a moonlight-hued [[Planetar|XMM]], or a benevolent lycanthrope, commonly a [[Werebear|XMM]]. Lycanthropes are said to be blessed by Selûne.

The principal legend about Selûne recounts the battle at the beginning of time between Selûne and her sister, Shar. The Tears of Selûne, the cluster of starry lights that follow the moon around the sky, are said to be the result of her joy, sorrow, or both.

Selûne is venerated by navigators, sailors, those who work at night, those seeking protection in the dark, the lost, and the questing. Temples to the Moonmaiden include a series of windows that reveal the moon in the night sky at various positions and in different phases throughout the year.

Selûne's rites include trances and meditation. Those who favor her set a bowl of milk outside on each night of the full moon.

Chosen of Selûne step into danger to light the way through darkness. A select few of her Chosen can create moonfire, a mysterious substance that grants magical power to objects or people.

## Swords of the Lady

The Swords of the Lady is an order of knights devoted to Selûne. Swords are known for an incongruously jovial, even joking, nature, as well as for their unpredictable tactics in battle. The order welcomes those who contemplate the moon and her lessons. The Swords of the Lady eagerly seeks out and recruit arcane spellcasters who were born under a full moon.

Individuals seeking to join the Swords of the Lady are welcomed as Slivers, referring to the first glint of light following the dark of a new moon. Slivers learn the unorthodox manner in which Swords carry out their duty and are encouraged to improvise, use their surroundings, and otherwise employ change and surprise when facing enemies of the Lady.

Once a Sliver has proven worthy in the eyes of their comrades and superiors, the initiate undergoes a vigil held under a waxing half-moon, symbolizing the way in which the new knight's commitment and responsibility has grown. The knight receives their vestments: a tabard, cloak, and cloth mask of gleaming white fabric stitched with silver. (If your campaign uses renown, a character must also have a Renown Score of 3+ with the Swords of the Lady to be knighted.)

Thereafter, the new Sword trains in battle skills, learning a smattering of divine or arcane magic. Swords of the Lady wield both magic and steel to confound their enemies and glorify the Moonmaiden. Swords receive a free Comfortable lifestyle at the organization's holdings. If they demonstrate legitimate need, Swords can secure silvered weaponry on loan or buy these weapons for half their normal price. In times of crisis, a knight can call on a friendly lycanthrope to aid the fight against Selûne's enemies.

The Swords of the Lady sets itself against the children of Shar. The order also finds bitter enemies in the followers of Mask, god of thieves, as well as Umberlee for her callous endangerment of sailors on night seas. They find allies in the followers of Lathander, Mystra, and Sune.
