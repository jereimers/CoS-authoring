## Actions

**Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 17). Until the grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the giant can't use this attack on anyone else.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d6 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.



## Reactions

**Furious Defense.** After a creature the giant can see is dealt damage by a foe within 20 feet of the giant, the giant makes a chain attack against that foe.
