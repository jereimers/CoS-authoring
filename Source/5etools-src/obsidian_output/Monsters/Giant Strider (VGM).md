## Traits

**Fire Absorption.** Whenever the giant strider is subjected to fire damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to half the fire damage dealt.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Fire Burst {@recharge 5}.** The giant strider hurls a gout of flame at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (**4d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners, and it ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried.
