# Blight

*4th-level necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

A creature that you can see within range makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **8d8** Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Plant creature automatically fails the save.

Alternatively, target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or shrub. It doesn't make a save; it simply withers and dies.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `8d8` for each spell slot level above 4.
