## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The nycaloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The nycaloth's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nycaloth makes two melee attacks, or it makes one melee attack and teleports before or after the attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (**2d4**) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns due to a fiendish wound. Each time the nycaloth hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (**2d4**). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([[Medicine]]) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

**Greataxe.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h18 (**2d12 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Teleport.** The nycaloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
