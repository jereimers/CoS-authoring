# Staff of Fire

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[burning hands]] (1 charge), [[fireball]] (3 charges), or [[wall of fire]] (4 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
