## Traits

**Incorporeal Movement.** The horror can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the horror can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Shadow Stride.** As a bonus action, the horror can step into a shadow within 5 feet of it and magically appear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of a second shadow that is up to 60 feet away. Both shadows must be cast by a Small or larger creature or object.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the horror has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h21 (**4d8 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the horror until the end of the target's next turn.
