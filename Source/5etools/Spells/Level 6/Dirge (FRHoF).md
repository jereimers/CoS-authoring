*6th-level enchantment*

**Range:** {'type': 'emanation', 'distance': {'type': 'feet', 'amount': 60}}  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Deathly power fills a 60-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you for the duration.

When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature can't regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]] while in the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Whenever the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes **3d10** Necrotic damage and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and its [[Speed|XPHB]] is halved. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

## Casting as a Circle Spell

Casting this as a Circle spell requires a minimum of two secondary casters. If the spell is cast as a Circle spell, its duration becomes [[Concentration]], up to 10 minutes.

A creature that fails its save against the spell's effect also gains 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level. While the creature has [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] levels, finishing a [[Long Rest|XPHB]] neither restores lost [[Hit Points|XPHB]] nor reduces the creature's [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level.

When the spell is cast, each secondary caster must expend a level 4+ spell slot; otherwise, the spell fails.
