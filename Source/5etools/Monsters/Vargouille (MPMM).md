## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) poison damage.

**Abyssal Curse.** The vargouille targets one [[incapacitated]] Humanoid within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target loses 1 point of Charisma after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a [[daylight]] spell; don't count that time. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, it dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille. Casting [[remove curse]], [[greater restoration]], or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete can end the curse. Doing so undoes the changes made to the target by the curse.

**Stunning Shriek {@recharge 5}.** The vargouille shrieks. Each Humanoid and Beast within 30 feet of the vargouille and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the vargouille until the end of the vargouille's next turn. While [[frightened]] in this way, a target is [[stunned]]. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Stunning Shriek of all vargouilles for 1 hour.
