## Traits

**Deathly Choir.** Any creature within 10 feet of Rahadin that isn't protected by a [[mind blank]] spell hears in its mind the screams of the thousands of people Rahadin has killed. As a bonus action, Rahadin can force all creatures that can hear the screams to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. Each creature takes 16 (**3d10**) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Fey Ancestry.** Rahadin has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put him to sleep.

**Mask of the Wild.** Rahadin can attempt to hide even when he is only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Rahadin attacks three times with his scimitar, or twice with his [[poisoned]] darts.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d6 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Poisoned Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d4 + 6**) piercing damage plus 5 (**2d4**) poison damage.
