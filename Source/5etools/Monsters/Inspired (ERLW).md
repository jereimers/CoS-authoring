## Traits

**Dual Mind.** The Inspired has advantage on Wisdom saving throws.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Inspired makes two crysteel dagger attacks. It can replace one attack with vicious mockery.

**Crysteel Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) force damage.

**Vicious Mockery (Cantrip).** The Inspired unleashes a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can hear the Inspired, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 2 (**1d4**) psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
