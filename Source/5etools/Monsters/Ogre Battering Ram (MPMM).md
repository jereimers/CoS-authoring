## Traits

**Siege Monster.** The ogre deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The ogre makes two Bash attacks.

**Bash.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and the ogre can push the target 5 feet away if the target is Huge or smaller.



## Reactions

**Block the Path.** When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the ogre, the ogre makes a Bash attack against that creature. If the attack hits, the target's speed is reduced to 0 until the start of the ogre's next turn.
