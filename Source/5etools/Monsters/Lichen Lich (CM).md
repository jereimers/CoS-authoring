## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Rejuvenation.** If it has a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in `1d10` days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The lich makes four attacks.

**Poisonous Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h17 (**5d6**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Wither.** Ranged Spell Attack +9 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage.

**Fire Storm (7th-Level Spell; 1/Day).** The lich fills up to ten 10-foot cubes with fire. Every cube must be within 150 feet of the lich and occupy a space the lich can see, and each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 (**7d10**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If the lich chooses, plant life in the area is unaffected by the spell.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Attack.** The lich makes an attack.

**Poison Prick (Cost 2 Actions).** The lich targets one [[poisoned]] creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or fall [[unconscious]] until the [[poisoned]] condition ends on it.

**Sap Life (Costs 2 Actions).** The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (**2d10**) necrotic damage. The lich regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage that the creature takes.
