## Traits

**Amphibious.** The hag can breathe air and water.

**Mimicry (Green Hag).** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check.


## Actions

**Illusory Appearance.** The hag covers herself with a magical illusion that allows her to look like another creature of her general size and shape. The illusion ends when the hag chooses, or if she dies. A DC 20 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check will expose the hag's disguise.

**Invisible Passage.** The hag magically turns [[invisible]] until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her [[concentration]] ends. While [[invisible]], she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, and can only be tracked by magic.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, one target. @h17 (**2d8 + 4**) slashing damage.
