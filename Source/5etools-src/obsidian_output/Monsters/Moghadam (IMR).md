## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Moghadam wields [[Ruinblade|IMR]] (see appendix C).

**Artificial Mind.** Moghadam can manifest an artificial mind as a floating spectral image of a [[demilich]]'s jeweled skull. Moghadam can communicate telepathically with this mind, send it up to 300 feet away from him, and see and hear through it.

**Infoportation (1/Day).** Moghadam can teleport himself into an unoccupied space next to his artificial mind.


## Actions

**Ruinblade.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Blight (1/Day).** While wielding [[Ruinblade|IMR]], Moghadam can cast the [[blight]] spell (DC 15).

**Disintegrate (1/7 Days).** While wielding [[Ruinblade|IMR]], Moghadam can cast the [[disintegrate]] spell against any nonmagical object or creation of magical force.

**Information Overload {@recharge 5}.** Moghadam overloads the thoughts of one creature within 5 feet of either himself or his artificial mind. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (**4d8 + 4**) psychic damage, and the next attack roll made against the target before the end of Moghadam's next turn has advantage.
