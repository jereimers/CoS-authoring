## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The aartuk can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The aartuk makes two Branch attacks, two Radiant Pellet attacks, or one of each.

**Branch.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h8 (**2d6 + 1**) bludgeoning damage.

**Radiant Pellet.** Ranged Spell Attack +2 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h7 (**3d4**) radiant damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Rally the Troops (1/Day).** The aartuk magically ends the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions on itself and each creature of its choice that it can see within 30 feet of itself.

**Tongue {@recharge}.** The aartuk tries to use its gooey tongue to snare one Medium or smaller creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is [[grappled]] by the tongue (escape DC 11) and pulled up to 25 feet toward the aartuk. The tongue can grapple one creature at a time.
