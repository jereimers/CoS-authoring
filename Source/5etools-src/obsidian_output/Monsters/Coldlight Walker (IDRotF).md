## Traits

**Blinding Light.** The walker sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. As a bonus action, the walker can target one creature in its bright light that it can see and force it to succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the start of the walker's next turn.

**Icy Doom.** Any creature killed by the walker freezes for 9 days, during which time it can't be thawed, harmed by fire, animated, or raised from the dead.

**Unusual Nature.** The walker doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Multiattack.** The walker makes two attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (**4d6**) cold damage.

**Cold Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack +3 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. @h25 (**4d10 + 3**) cold damage.
