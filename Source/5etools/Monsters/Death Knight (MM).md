## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The death knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Marshal Undead.** Unless the death knight is [[incapacitated]], it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The death knight makes three longsword attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d8 + 5**) slashing damage, or 10 (**1d10 + 5**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (**4d8**) necrotic damage.

**Hellfire Orb (1/Day).** The death knight hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 35 (**10d6**) fire damage and 35 (**10d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Parry.** The death knight adds 6 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the death knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
