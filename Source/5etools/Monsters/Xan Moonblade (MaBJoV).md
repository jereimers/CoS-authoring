**Enchanter.** When Xan casts hideous laughter, hold person, or suggestion, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw.

**Fey Ancestry.** Xan has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put Xan to sleep.

**Special Equipment.** Xan wields a [[Moonblade]]. The [[Moonblade]] has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls (already factored into Xan's attacks) and has the finesse property.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Xan makes three Moonblade attacks.

**Moonblade.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) slashing damage or 11 (**1d10 + 6**) slashing damage if wielded with two hands, plus 7 (**2d6**) cold or fire damage (Xan's choice).
