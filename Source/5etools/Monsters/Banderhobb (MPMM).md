## Traits

**Resonant Connection.** If the banderhobb has even a tiny piece of a creature or an object in its possession, such as a lock of hair or a splinter of wood, it knows the most direct route to that creature or object if it is within 1 mile of the banderhobb.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The banderhobb makes one Bite attack and one Tongue attack. It can replace one attack with a use of Shadow Step.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the banderhobb can't use its Bite attack or Tongue attack on another target.

**Tongue.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. @h10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the banderhobb.

**Shadow Step.** The banderhobb teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of dim light or darkness that it can see.

**Swallow.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature [[grappled]] by the banderhobb. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) piercing damage. The creature is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the banderhobb, and it takes 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage at the start of each of the banderhobb's turns. A creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way stops taking the necrotic damage and becomes stable.

The banderhobb can have only one creature swallowed at a time. While the banderhobb isn't [[incapacitated]], it can regurgitate the creature at any time (no action required) in a space within 5 feet of it. The creature exits [[prone]]. If the banderhobb dies, it likewise regurgitates a swallowed creature.


## Bonus Actions

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the banderhobb takes the [[Hide]] action.
