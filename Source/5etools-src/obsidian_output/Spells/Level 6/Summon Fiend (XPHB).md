You call forth a fiendish spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [[Fiendish Spirit|XPHB]] stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Demon, Devil, or Yugoloth. The creature resembles a Fiend of the chosen type, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[Dodge|XPHB]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
