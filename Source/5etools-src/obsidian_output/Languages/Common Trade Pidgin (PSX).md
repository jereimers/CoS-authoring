# Common Trade Pidgin

**Type:** Standard  
**Script:** None  
**Typical Speakers:** Sun Empire, River Heralds, Legion of Dusk, Brazen Coalition, {@race Human (Ixalan)|PSX|Humans}, {@race Orc (Ixalan)|PSX|Orcs}, {@race Siren|PSX|Sirens}, {@race Goblin (Ixalan)|PSX|Goblins}

A trade pidgin used in circumstances where members of different peoples do interact with each other. But this language is almost impossible to use for discussions of matters of any depth.
