## Building a Knight of Solamnia Character

Any class that has martial prowess can be a good fit in the Knights of Solamnia. [[Fighter|]] and [[paladin|]] make up the bulk of the knighthood's forces. [[Cleric|]] (often with the [[Cleric|PHB]] domain) can also be found among the knights' ranks.

For a more unusual take on a Knight of Solamnia character, consider playing a bard of the [[Bard|PHB]] (or the [[Bard|PHB]] from [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE]]) or a [[barbarian]] devoted to the ideals of the nature god [[Habbakuk|dragonlance]] (perhaps adopting the [[barbarian|]] from [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE]]).

### Knight of Solamnia Trinkets

When you make your character, roll once on the Knight of Solamnia Trinkets table instead of on the [[Trinket|PHB]] in the Player's Handbook for your starting trinket.
