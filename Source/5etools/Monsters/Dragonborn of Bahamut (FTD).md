## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day).** If the dragonborn fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragonborn makes three Longsword attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 13 (**3d8**) radiant damage. The dragonborn can cause the sword to flare with bright light, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the start of the dragonborn's next turn. The sword can flare in this way only once per turn.

**Healing Touch (1/Day).** The dragonborn touches another creature within 5 feet of it. The target magically regains 40 hit points. In addition, all diseases and poisons affecting the target are removed.

**Radiant Breath {@recharge}.** The dragonborn exhales fiery radiance in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (**8d10**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the dragonborn uses this action, it can choose up to three creatures in the cone. These creatures take no damage from the radiance and instead regain 22 (`4d10`) hit points each.
