## Traits

**Lightning Absorption.** Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to Lightning damage, it regains a number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the Lightning damage dealt.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The shambling mound makes three Charged Tendril attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Engulf.

**Charged Tendril.** m +7, reach 10 ft. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) Bludgeoning damage plus 5 (**2d4**) Lightning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the shambling mound pulls the target 5 feet straight toward itself.

**Engulf.** str DC 15, one Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet. @actSaveFail The target is pulled into the shambling mound's space and has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions, and it takes 10 (**3d6**) Lightning damage at the start of each of its turns. When the shambling mound moves, the [[Grappled|XPHB]] target moves with it, costing it no extra movement. The shambling mound can have only one creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by this action at a time.
