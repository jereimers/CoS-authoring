## Traits

**Tunneler.** The worm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d8 + 9**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm, and it takes 21 (**6d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the worm's turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Tail Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h19 (**3d6 + 9**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (**12d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
