## Traits

**Hold Breath.** The ssurran can hold its breath for 15 minutes.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The ssurran makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) slashing damage.

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) poison damage.

**Poison Bomb.** The ssurran throws a tangerine-sized bomb at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes, releasing a 10-foot-radius sphere of poisonous gas that disperses quickly. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the ssurran throws a bomb, roll a `d6`; on a roll of 4 or lower, the ssurran has no more bombs to throw.
