# Sinkhole

Sinkholes occur when sand fills the top half of a large cavity in rock or other hard earth. When a creature steps onto the sand, the ground collapses down into the bottom half of the cavity, injuring those caught in the sinkhole and leaving them stranded below the surface.

As a [[Search|XPHB]] action, a creature can detect a sinkhole with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]]) check. Once a sinkhole is spotted, it can usually be avoided by moving around it.

A creature that walks onto a sinkhole must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity check or fall 10 feet to the bottom of the sinkhole. A creature without a Climb Speed can climb out of the sinkhole with a successful DC 15 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the sinkhole's depth, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Sinkhole Depth |
|---|---|
| 5–10 | 30 feet |
| 11–16 | 60 feet |
| 17–20 | 120 feet |
