# Iron Spikes

*Item, None*

Iron Spikes come in bundles of ten. As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can use a blunt object, such as a [[Light Hammer|XPHB]], to hammer a spike into wood, earth, or a similar material. You can do so to jam a door shut or to then tie a [[Rope|XPHB]] or [[Chain|XPHB]] to the Spike.
