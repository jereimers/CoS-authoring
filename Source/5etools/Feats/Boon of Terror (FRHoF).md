# Boon of Terror

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Fearless

You have [[Immunity|XPHB]] to the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition.

## Flee, Fools!

When a creature with the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition starts its turn within 60 feet of you, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to stoke its terror, provided you can see the creature and it isn't behind [[Cover|XPHB]]. If you do so, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or spend its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

## Intimidating

You gain [[Proficiency|XPHB]] in the [[Intimidation|XPHB]] skill if you don't already have it. You also gain [[Expertise|XPHB]] in [[Intimidation|XPHB]].
