## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the war devil's darkvision.

**Fear Aura.** Any hostile creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the war devil must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[frightened]] condition until the start of the creature's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the war devil's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours. This ability doesn't function if the war devil is [[unconscious]].

**Magic Resistance.** The war devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The war devil makes two attacks using its Cold- Iron Ranseur, Claws, or a combination of the two.

**Cold-Iron Ranseur.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h23 (**3d10 + 7**) force damage plus 14 (**4d6**) cold damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d8 + 7**) slashing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 20). While a creature is [[grappled]], the war devil can't make Claws attacks.
