# Cloud of Daggers

*2nd-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a sliver of glass)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes **4d4** Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there or if the [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

On your later turns, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to teleport the [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] up to 30 feet.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `4d4` for each spell slot level above 2.
