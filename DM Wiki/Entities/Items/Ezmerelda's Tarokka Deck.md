# Ezmerelda's Tarokka Deck

## Description
[[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]] keeps a **deck of tarokka cards** in her wagon. Although the cards themselves aren't magical, Ezmerelda—as a Vistana—can use them to perform a tarokka card reading, similar to the reading that can be performed by [[Madam Eva]].

The tarokka is a traditional Vistani fortune-telling deck, used to divine the future and provide guidance. Each card in the deck has symbolic meaning, and a skilled reader can interpret the cards to reveal hidden truths.

## Properties
- **Type:** Adventuring Gear
- **Magical:** No (the cards are not magical)
- **Rarity:** Common
- **Attunement:** No

## Location
The deck is kept in Ezmerelda's wagon (Chapter 11, area V1).

## Usage
Ezmerelda can use this deck to perform a card reading for the characters, providing an alternative to [[Madam Eva]]'s reading if the players encounter Ezmerelda first or need a second reading.

## Notes
- Can serve as a backup method to receive the tarokka reading if players miss [[Madam Eva]]
- Demonstrates Ezmerelda's connection to her Vistani heritage despite her estrangement
- The reading will produce the same prophetic results as [[Madam Eva]]'s reading
