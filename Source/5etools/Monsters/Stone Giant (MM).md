## Traits

**Stone Camouflage.** The giant has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two greatclub attacks.

**Greatclub.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].



## Reactions

**Rock Catching.** If a rock or similar object is hurled at the giant, the giant can, with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, catch the missile and take no bludgeoning damage from it.
