## Traits

**Halfling Nimbleness.** Oren can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than his.

**Lucky.** When Oren rolls a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, he can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Stout Resilience.** Oren has advantage on saving throws against poison

**Roleplaying Information.** Oren came to Nurthfurrow's End looking for easy work and found it. He sings for his supper, drinks like a fish, and wanders the fields at night dreaming up new lyrics to entertain the inn's other guests. Oren likes to stir up trouble from time to time, but he doesn't have a mean bone in his body.

Ideal: "Music is food for the soul."

Bond: "You had me at "Can I buy you a drink."

Flaw: "I have a knack for putting myself in harm's way. Good thing I'm lucky!"
