## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** Qunbraxel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Qunbraxel makes two Eldritch Bolt attacks, or one Eldritch Bolt attack and one Tentacle attack.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16) and must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the grapple ends.

**Eldritch Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d10 + 4**) force damage.

**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Humanoid with the [[stunned]] condition who is [[grappled]] by Qunbraxel. @h55 (**10d10**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, Qunbraxel kills it by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** Qunbraxel magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 26 (**5d8 + 4**) psychic damage and have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
