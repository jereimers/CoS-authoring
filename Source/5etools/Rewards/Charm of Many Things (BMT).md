# Charm of Many Things

*Charm*

You are infused with a burst of magic from a [[Deck of Many Things]]. As an action, you can touch a willing creature other than yourself and bestow the effect of a single randomly determined card from the deck upon the target. Once you use this charm, it vanishes from you.
