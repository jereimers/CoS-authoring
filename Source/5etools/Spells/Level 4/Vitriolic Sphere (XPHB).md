You point at a location within range, and a glowing, 1-foot-diameter ball of acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **10d4** Acid damage and another **5d4** Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage only.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The initial damage increases by `10d4` for each spell slot level above 4.
