# Strawbundle's Charm

*Charm*

While you have Strawbundle in your possession, this charm allows you to cast the [[etherealness]] spell as an action, no components required. After it is used three times, the charm vanishes.

The doll is a Tiny construct. Destroying the doll causes the child's soul within it to become trapped in [[the Soulmonger|ToA]].
