## Traits

**Haunted Zone.** con DC 17, any creature that casts a spell while inside the revenant's space. @actSaveFail The spell fails and is wasted.

**Undead Restoration.** If the revenant dies, it revives 24 hours later unless [[Dispel Evil and Good|XPHB]] is cast on its remains. If it revives, it animates another Gargantuan object or structure elsewhere on the same plane of existence; it now looks different but uses the same stat block and returns with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The revenant makes two [[Object|XPHB]] Slam attacks and uses Invitation.

**Object Slam.** m,r +9 (with [[Advantage|XPHB]] if the target is inside the revenant's space), reach 10 ft. or range 30/90 ft. @h27 (**5d8 + 5**) Bludgeoning damage.

**Invitation.** cha DC 17, each creature in a 60-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. @actSaveFail The target is teleported inside the revenant's space and swallowed. A swallowed creature has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the revenant.

While the revenant has [[Hit Points|XPHB]], a swallowed creature can leave the revenant's space only by using magic that enables planar travel, such as the [[Plane Shift|XPHB]] spell.
