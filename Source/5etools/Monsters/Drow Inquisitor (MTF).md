**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Death Lance.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) piercing damage plus 18 (**4d8**) necrotic damage.
