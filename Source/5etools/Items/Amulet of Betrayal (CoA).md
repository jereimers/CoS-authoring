# Amulet of Betrayal

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You can use a bonus action to move one of the following conditions from yourself to an ally within 60 feet of you: [[blinded]], [[deafened]], [[frightened]], [[poisoned]], [[stunned]], [[exhaustion]]. When transferring [[exhaustion]], move all your [[exhaustion]] levels. If the chosen ally is immune to a transferred condition, the transfer fails.
