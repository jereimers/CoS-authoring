# Locking Spellbook

*Item, None*

This 100-page leather-bound tome can be used as a Spellbook. It is closed with a lock that comes with a key. As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, a creature can try to pick the lock using [[Thieves' Tools|XPHB]], doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([[Sleight of Hand|XPHB]]) check.
