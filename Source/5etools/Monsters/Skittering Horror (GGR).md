## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The horror can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the horror has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The horror can use its Maddening Presence and make three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d10 + 6**) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h24 (**4d8 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Maddening Presence.** The horror targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see or hear the horror, the target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the target becomes [[paralyzed]] until the end of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the horror's Maddening Presence for the next 24 hours.
