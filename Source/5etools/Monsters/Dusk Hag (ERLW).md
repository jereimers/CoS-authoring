## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hag makes two Nightmare Touch attacks.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Nightmare Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h18 (**4d6 + 4**) psychic damage. If the target is [[unconscious]], it takes an extra 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage and is cursed until the hag dies or the curse is removed. The cursed creature's hit point maximum decreases by 5 (`1d10`) whenever it finishes a long rest.



## Reactions

**Dream Eater.** When an [[unconscious]] creature the hag can see within 30 feet of her regains consciousness, the hag can force the creature to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature takes 11 (**2d10**) psychic damage, and the hag regains hit points equal to the amount of damage taken.
