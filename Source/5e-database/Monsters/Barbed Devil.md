## Special Abilities

**Barbed Hide.** At the start of each of its turns, the barbed devil deals 5 (1d10) piercing damage to any creature grappling it.

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance.** The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The devil makes three melee attacks: one with its tail and two with its claws. Alternatively, it can use Hurl Flame twice.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Hurl Flame.** Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
