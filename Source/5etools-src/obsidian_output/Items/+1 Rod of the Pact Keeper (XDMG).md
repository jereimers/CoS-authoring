*Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement by a warlock)*

While holding this rod, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your Warlock spells.

In addition, you can regain one spell slot as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action while holding the rod. You can't use this property again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
