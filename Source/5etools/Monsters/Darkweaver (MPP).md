## Traits

**Shadowy Form.** While the darkweaver is in dim light or darkness, attack rolls against it are made with disadvantage unless the darkweaver has the [[incapacitated]] condition.

**Spider Climb.** The darkweaver can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Sunlight Hypersensitivity.** The darkweaver takes 10 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The darkweaver makes two Shadow Web attacks and one Bite attack. It can use Reel after any of these attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 17 (**5d6**) necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

**Shadow Web.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 120 ft., one creature. @h16 (**3d10**) necrotic damage, and the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 15). The shadow web can be attacked and destroyed (AC 16; 20 hit points; vulnerability to radiant damage; immunity to bludgeoning, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage). The darkweaver can grapple up to six creatures at a time using its shadow web.

**Reel.** The darkweaver pulls each creature it has [[grappled]] up to 60 feet toward itself.
