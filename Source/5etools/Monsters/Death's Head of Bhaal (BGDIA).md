## Traits

**Aura of Murder.** As long as the death's head is not [[incapacitated]], hostile creatures within 5 feet of it gain vulnerability to piercing damage unless they have resistance or immunity to such damage.

**Magic Resistance.** The death's head has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The death's head uses Stunning Gaze and makes two dagger attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d4 + 5**) piercing damage.

**Stunning Gaze.** The death's head targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn.



## Reactions

**Unstoppable (3/Day).** The death's head reduces the damage it takes from an attack to 0.
