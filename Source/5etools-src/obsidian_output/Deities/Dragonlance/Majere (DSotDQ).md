# Majere

**Pantheon:** Dragonlance  
**Alignment:** Lawful Good  
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** Copper spider

Austere and aloof, Majere is the god of meditation and discipline. Monks, his most devoted followers, honor him by leading lives of quiet contemplation in remote monasteries. Many orphans are raised in the monasteries of Majere; some become monks themselves, while those who leave the monastic life often take the surname Majere out of respect.
