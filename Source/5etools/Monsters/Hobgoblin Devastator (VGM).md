## Traits

**Arcane Advantage.** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 7 (**2d6**) damage to a creature it hits with a damaging spell attack if that target is within 5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin and that ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Army Arcana.** When the hobgoblin casts a spell that causes damage or that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, it can choose itself and any number of allies to be immune to the damage caused by the spell and to succeed on the required saving throw.


## Actions

**Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) bludgeoning damage, or 5 (**1d8 + 1**) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
