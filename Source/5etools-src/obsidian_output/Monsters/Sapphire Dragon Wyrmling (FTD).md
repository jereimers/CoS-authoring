## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The dragon can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and can leave a 5-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) thunder damage.

**Debilitating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a pulse of high-pitched, nearly inaudible sound in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (**4d10**) thunder damage and is [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[incapacitated]].
