# Melf's Acid Arrow

*2nd-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 90 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **4d4** Acid damage and **2d4** Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage (both initial and later) increases by `4d4;2d4` for each spell slot level above 2.
