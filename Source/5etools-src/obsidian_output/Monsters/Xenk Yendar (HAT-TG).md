## Traits

**Aura of Protection.** Xenk and his allies within 10 feet of him have advantage on saving throws.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Xenk makes three Daggersword attacks and uses Daggersword Flourish. He can replace Daggersword Flourish with Cleansing Touch if it's available.

**Daggersword.** Choose the attack that corresponds to the daggersword's current form (see Daggersword Shift below):

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 6 (**1d12**) radiant damage.

**Shortsword and Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 6 (**1d12**) radiant damage.

**Daggersword Flourish.** Choose the option that corresponds to the daggersword's current form (see Daggersword Shift below):

**Longsword.** Xenk magically detaches the longsword's blade from its hilt, launching the blade at a creature he can see within 30 feet of himself. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target is impaled by the blade, taking 14 (**3d6 + 4**) piercing damage, and is knocked [[prone]]. At the end of the current turn, the blade magically reattaches to its hilt.

**Shortsword and Dagger.** Xenk lashes out with both weapons. Each creature of his choice within 10 feet of him must make a DC 16 Dexterity throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (**2d6**) piercing damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of Xenk's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.

**Cleansing Touch (1/Day).** Xenk touches a creature within 5 feet of himself. The target magically regains 27 (`6d8`) hit points and gains the benefit of a [[lesser restoration]] spell.


## Bonus Actions

**Daggersword Shift.** Xenk changes the form of his daggersword, choosing one of the following forms: a longsword, or a shortsword in one hand and a dagger in the other.
