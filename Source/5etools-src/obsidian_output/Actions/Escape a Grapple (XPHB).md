# Escape a Grapple

**Time:** 1 action

A Grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) check against the grapple's escape DC, ending the [[Condition|XPHB]] on itself on a success. The [[Condition|XPHB]] also ends if the grappler has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition or if the distance between the Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grapple's range.
