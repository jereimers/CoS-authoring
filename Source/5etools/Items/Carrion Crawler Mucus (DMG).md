# Carrion Crawler Mucus

*Item, None*

This poison must be harvested from a dead or [[incapacitated]] [[carrion crawler]]. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The [[poisoned]] creature is [[paralyzed]]. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
