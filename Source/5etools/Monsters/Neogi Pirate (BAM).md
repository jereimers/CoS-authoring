## Traits

**Mental Fortitude.** The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]], and magic can't put the neogi to sleep.

**Spider Climb.** The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The neogi makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.
