## Creature Type

You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a goblinoid for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a goblinoid.

## Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

## Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[charmed]] condition on yourself.

## Powerful Build

You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.
