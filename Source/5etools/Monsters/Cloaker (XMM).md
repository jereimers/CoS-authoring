## Traits

**Light Sensitivity.** While in [[Bright Light|XPHB]], the cloaker has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cloaker makes one Attach attack and two Tail attacks.

**Attach.** m +6, reach 5 ft. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) Piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, the cloaker attaches to it. While the cloaker is attached, the target has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition, and the cloaker can't make Attach attacks against other targets. In addition, the cloaker halves the damage it takes (round down), and the target takes the same amount of damage.

The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of movement. The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can take an action to try to detach the cloaker, doing so by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check.

**Tail.** m +6, reach 10 ft. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) Slashing damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Moan.** wis DC 13, each creature in a 60-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the cloaker. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the end of the cloaker's next turn. @actSaveSuccess The target is immune to this cloaker's Moan for the next 24 hours.
