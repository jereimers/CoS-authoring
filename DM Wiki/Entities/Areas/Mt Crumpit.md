# Overview

Mt. Crumpit is a jagged, mist-shrouded peak that rises northwest of [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], visible on clear days as a crooked silhouette against the gray sky. The mountain is home to [[The Grinch]], a bitter creature who has claimed its heights as his domain. Locals avoid the mountain, speaking of it only in hushed tones—a place where the Mists behave strangely and joy itself seems to wither.

# What the party knows

Vallakian children whisper that a "green devil" lives atop the mountain and steals toys from naughty children. Adults dismiss these stories, though guards admit the mountain gives them an uneasy feeling. The path up is treacherous, and those who venture too high rarely return unchanged.

# Notable places

- **The Threshold** - A ring of standing stones where the Mists grow thick and reality shifts
- **The Workshop** - A natural cave system the Grinch has converted into his cluttered lair, filled with stolen goods and strange gadgets
- **The Lookout** - A rocky ledge above the cave entrance where the Grinch watches Vallaki below

# Notable figures

- [[The Grinch]] - The bitter master of Mt. Crumpit
- [[Max]] - His loyal, mist-touched hound

# Map

*No map available. Consider a cave system layout: Entry Cavern branching into the Workroom and a passage leading deeper to the Vault and the Grinch's Chamber. The Lookout is accessible via a narrow climb from the cave mouth.*

# Approach & Ascent

## Finding the Mountain
Mt. Crumpit is visible from Vallaki's walls on clear days. The path begins at a barely-visible trailhead 2 miles northwest of the town gates. A DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check locates the trail; failure adds 1d4 hours to travel time.

## The Lower Slopes (1-2 hours travel)
- **Terrain:** Rocky, snow-dusted paths; difficult terrain
- **Weather:** Cold winds; characters without cold weather gear must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution save each hour or gain one level of exhaustion
- **Encounters:** None (the Grinch's presence keeps predators away)

## The Steep Ascent (2-3 hours travel)
- **Terrain:** Near-vertical climbs requiring DC 14 Strength (Athletics) checks; failure by 5+ results in a 20-foot fall (2d6 bludgeoning damage)
- **Hazards:** Loose rocks (DEX save DC 12 or 1d6 bludgeoning from rockslide)
- **Signs of the Grinch:** Claw marks on rocks, scattered mechanical parts, Max's pawprints

# Environmental Hazards

| Hazard              | Location        | Effect                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bitter Cold         | Entire mountain | CON save DC 10/hour or 1 exhaustion (without cold gear) |
| Loose Scree         | Steep Ascent    | DEX save DC 12 or 1d6 bludgeoning; triggers rockslide   |
| Thin Air            | Summit          | Disadvantage on Constitution saves                      |
| Mist Disorientation | The Threshold   | WIS save DC 13 or become lost (1d4 hours)               |

# The Threshold

## Description
Halfway up the mountain, travelers encounter a ring of ancient standing stones—moss-covered, leaning at odd angles. The Mists pool thickly here, swirling in patterns that seem almost deliberate. This is the boundary of the Grinch's domain: a **Mist-Pocket Demi-Refuge**.

## Crossing the Threshold
When characters enter the Threshold:
- The temperature drops sharply
- Sound becomes muffled
- Time feels... *wrong* (a DC 15 Intelligence check recognizes temporal distortion)
- A Wisdom save (DC 13) is required or the character becomes disoriented for 1d4 hours

## Metaphysical Properties
The Mist-pocket operates like the Abbey of Saint Markovia:
- **Magic Suppression:** Divination spells of 3rd level or lower automatically fail
- **Teleportation Block:** Teleportation into or out of the pocket fails unless the caster succeeds on a DC 18 spellcasting ability check
- **Time Dilation:** 1 hour inside = 30 minutes outside (or vice versa, at DM discretion)
- **Emotional Resonance:** The Grinch's bitterness suffuses the area; Charisma saves at disadvantage

# Workshop Exterior

## Description
Beyond the Threshold, the path winds upward to a dark opening in the mountainside—a natural cave mouth, half-hidden by an overhang of jagged rock. Over the years, the Grinch has fortified and expanded this cavern into his Workshop, reinforcing the entrance with salvaged timber and rusted metal plates. Smoke seeps from cracks in the rock above where a crude chimney has been vented through the stone. Warnings are scratched directly into the cave walls and painted on wooden planks nailed to the rock: "GO AWAY," "NO JOY ALLOWED," "TRESPASSERS WILL BE MISERABLE."

## Exterior Features
- **Cave Mouth:** The entrance is roughly 8 feet wide and 6 feet tall, narrowing as it leads inward. A heavy curtain of oiled canvas keeps out the wind.
- **Makeshift Alarm:** Trip wires connected to clattering pots span the entrance; DC 14 Perception to notice, DC 12 Dexterity to disarm. Alerts the Grinch if triggered.
- **Max's Nook:** A sheltered alcove just inside the cave mouth, lined with old blankets. Max often rests here, watching the approach.
- **Junk Piles:** Broken toys, discarded gadgets, and salvaged materials are scattered near the entrance. A DC 15 Investigation check finds 2d10 gp worth of salvageable parts.
- **The Lookout:** A rocky ledge above the cave entrance with a clear view of Vallaki. A battered telescope (functional) points at the town square.

# Workshop Interior Zones

The cave system consists of several connected chambers, shaped by water and time, then modified by the Grinch over years of bitter industry. The walls bear tool marks where he widened passages, and salvaged timber shores up unstable sections.

## Zone 1: Entry Cavern
- The main passage opens into a low-ceilinged chamber cluttered with stolen goods: toys, decorations, food, small luxuries
- The natural rock walls are blackened by torch smoke; hooks and shelves have been hammered into the stone
- Trap: **Collapsing Shelf** (triggered by touching certain items; DC 13 Dex save or 2d6 bludgeoning and prone)
- Max often greets visitors here

## Zone 2: The Workroom
- A side chamber the Grinch converted into his gadget-crafting space
- Workbenches built from salvaged wood line the walls; stalactites have been broken off to make room
- A forge built into a natural fissure vents smoke through cracks in the ceiling
- **Loot:** [[Sleigh Boots]] (on a high shelf carved into the rock), 1d4 Snap-Trap Nets, tinker's tools, 50 gp of components

## Zone 3: The Vault
- A narrow passage leads to a smaller cave where the Grinch hoards stolen items
- Heavy wooden door fitted into the cave mouth (DC 16 Thieves' Tools to pick)
- Contains: Blinsky toys, festival decorations, children's gifts, 150 gp in coin and valuables
- A shrine-like arrangement of items Max likes (bones, blankets, a chew toy) sits in a corner alcove

## Zone 4: The Grinch's Chamber
- The deepest chamber, warmed by a fireplace built into a natural chimney formation
- Surprisingly sparse: a bed of piled furs, a single wooden chair, shelves carved into the rock
- Evidence of loneliness: a single plate, a single cup, books with worn spines stacked against the wall
- If the Grinch is asleep, he can be found here with Max curled at the foot of his bed

# Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Grinch can take one lair action while within his Workshop:

1. **Trigger Trap:** A hidden mechanism activates. One creature the Grinch can see must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained until the end of its next turn.

2. **Douse the Lights:** All nonmagical light sources in the Workshop are extinguished. The Grinch has darkvision; most intruders do not.

3. **Mist Surge:** The Mists within the Workshop thicken. Until initiative count 20 of the next round, the area is lightly obscured, and creatures other than the Grinch and Max have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

4. **Max, Attack!:** Max immediately moves up to his speed and makes a Bite attack against a creature of the Grinch's choice (uses Max's reaction).

# Teleportation / Magic Restrictions

| Spell Type | Effect Within Mist-Pocket |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Divination (3rd level or lower) | Automatically fails |
| Teleportation | Requires DC 18 ability check or fails |
| Conjuration (summoning) | Functions normally |
| Illusion | +2 to save DCs (the Mists enhance deception) |
| Necromancy | Functions normally |

# Comparison to Abbey of Saint Markovia

Like the Abbey, Mt. Crumpit is a **localized anomaly** where the Mists create a bubble of altered reality:

| Feature | Abbey | Mt. Crumpit |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Master | The Abbot | The Grinch |
| Purpose | Twisted sanctuary | Bitter isolation |
| Mist Effect | Madness | Emotional suppression |
| Time Distortion | Minimal | Noticeable |
| Redemption Potential | Ambiguous | High |

Both locations represent what happens when an individual is shaped by prolonged exposure to the Mists. The Abbot became alien; the Grinch became bitter. Both are prisons disguised as refuges.

# What Happens if the Grinch is Redeemed

If the Grinch is redeemed:
- The Mist-pocket stabilizes; the Workshop becomes less oppressive
- The stolen goods can be returned to Vallaki
- Mt. Crumpit may become a **safe haven** for the party—the Grinch offers shelter and gadgets
- Max becomes friendlier to all visitors
- The Threshold remains, but crossing it no longer requires a Wisdom save

# What Happens if the Grinch is Slain

If the Grinch is killed:
- The Mist-pocket begins to collapse over 7 days
- The cave system becomes unstable; rocks fall, passages collapse
- Max howls for three days, then vanishes into the Mists
- After 7 days, Mt. Crumpit is no longer accessible—the Mists swallow it entirely
- Vallakian children tell darker stories; the legend grows more fearsome

*No images available.*

# Notes
- Mt. Crumpit is designed as a vertical dungeon with exploration, social, and combat encounters
- The Mist-pocket mechanics should feel eerie but not punishing
- The cave Workshop should feel like a villain's lair carved from the mountain itself—claustrophobic, rough-hewn, but with hints of tragedy (single plate, Max's shrine, worn books)
- The natural cave setting gives the Grinch home-field advantage; he knows every passage and hiding spot
- Combat here should favor the Grinch; retreat is a valid option for the party
