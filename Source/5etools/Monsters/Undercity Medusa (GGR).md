## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The medusa has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Surprise Attack.** During the first round of combat, the medusa has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that is [[surprised]], and it deals an extra 10 (**3d6**) damage each time it hits such a creature with an attack.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The medusa makes two claw attacks. It can also use Petrifying Gaze before or after making these attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Petrifying Gaze.** The medusa fixes its gaze on one creature within 60 feet of it that it can see and that can see its eyes. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly [[petrified]]. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is [[restrained]]. The [[restrained]] creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [[petrified]] on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by a [[greater restoration]] spell or similar magic.
