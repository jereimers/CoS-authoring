# Areas of Barovia (A-I)

The following areas correspond to labels on the map of Barovia below and on the poster map.

## A. Old Svalich Road

Black pools of water stand like dark mirrors in and around the muddy roadway. Giant trees loom on both sides of the road, their branches clawing at the mist.

If the characters are walking along the road, they arrive at area B after 5 hours. If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, the travel time is hal-4

## B. Gates of Barovia 

Two sets of these gates exist: one west of the village of Barovia and one east of the village.

The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.

If the characters are traveling on foot, the gates swing open as they approach, screeching as the hinges move. The gates close behind the characters after they pass through. If the characters are riding in Vistani wagons, the gates open in front of the lead wagon and close when the rear one has entered.

The eastern gates don't open for people trying to leave Strahd's domain unless they are accompanied by Vistani. The fog chokes any non-Vistani that passes through the gates or skirts around them when they are closed (see "Mists of Ravenloft" earlier in this chapter).

If Strahd is defeated, the gates of Barovia swing open, and the road east becomes clear of fog.

### THE LANDS OF BAROVIA: COMMON FEATURES

Unless the text says otherwise, the following rules apply to doors, secret doors, locks, and webs in these lands.
Doors. A wooden door can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength check, or DC 15 if the door is barred or reinforced in some other manner. Increase the DC by 5 if the door is made of stone, or by 10 if it is made of iron. Decrease the DC by 5 if the door is made of glass or amber, or if the door is weakened in some manner (such as by rot or corrosion).

#### Secret Doors. 
If there are obvious clues to a secret door's presence, such as scratch marks on a nearby wall or footprints leading to it, a character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher notices the secret door. Otherwise, finding a secret door requires a search of the area and a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### Locks. 
A creature proficient with thieves' tools can use them to pick a typical lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A typical padlock can be broken by smashing it with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon and succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check.

#### Webs. 
Characters can pass through ordinary webs, including thick cobwebs, without fear of being restrained or slowed down. A character can clear away the cobwebs from a 10 -foot square as an action. Webs woven by giant spiders are a different matter; see "Dungeon Hazards" in chapter 5 in the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on giant spider webs.

## C. Svalich Woods

%% --- Page 45 --- %%
Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream.

If the characters are traveling in Vistani wagons, they can continue on to the village of Barovia (area E) without incident.
If the characters are following the road on foot, the party member who has the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices something:

You catch the scent of death on the air.

The character can follow the stench to its source:

The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes are torn and raked with claw marks. Crows have been at the body, which is surrounded by the paw prints. The man has obviously been dead for several days. He holds a crumpled envelope in one hand.

The dead man, Dalvan Olensky, was trying to escape from Barovia with a letter from his master when he was killed on the road by Strahd's dire wolves. Wanting to return at once to Strahd, the wolves left the body in the woods but have not yet returned to feast.

The letter in Dalvan's hand has a large "B" set into its wax seal. The parchment is worn and flimsy. If the characters open and read the letter, show the players "Kolyan Indirovich's Letter (Version 2)" in appendix F. The letter is dated one week ago.

Dalvan was instructed to place the letter at the gates, in the hope that visitors would find it and turn back.
If the characters linger in the woods, they hear a lone wolf howl far off in the forest. Each round, one more wolf adds its voice to the howling, with the sound getting progressively closer to the party. If the characters are still in the woods after 5 rounds of howling, five dire wolves arrive and attack. If the characters are trying to leave Barovia, these dire wolves are joined by a pack of twenty wolves. The wolves and the dire wolves stop their attack if the characters return to the road and head toward the village of Barovia (area E).


## D. River Ivlis

When the characters come within sight of this river for the first time, read:

This river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley.

The river is roughly 50 feet wide, with a depth ranging from 5 to 10 feet. Arching stone bridges span the river at two points, one near the village of Barovia (area E) and the other near Tser Falls (area H).

## E. Village of Barovia

Chapter 3 describes the village of Barovia and the gloomy folk who reside there.
## F. River Ivlis Crossroads

Check for a random encounter whenever the characters reach area F, unless they are accompanied by Vistani.

An old wooden gallows creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam. The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: Barovia Village to the east, Tser Pool to the northwest, and Ravenloft/Vallaki to the

%% --- Page 46 --- %%
southwest. The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog.

The northwest fork leads down to the river and area G. The road southwest leads to area H. The east road leads to an arching stone bridge and continues on to the village of Barovia (area E). If the characters are traveling with Vistani, the Vistani lead them along the northwest road to the Vistani encampment.

The gallows stand atop a rotting platform 5 feet high, with wooden stairs leading up to it.
Eleven graves are here with blank gravestones. The forgotten people buried here were hanged from the gallows. Characters who dig up the graves find rotted coffins containing moldy bones.

### The Hanged One 

As the characters leave the area, read:

You hear a creaking noise behind you, coming from the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, gray body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly, so that it can fix its dead eyes upon you.

One random character sees him- or herself hanging from the gallows. The other characters see an unfamiliar Barovian. The corpse looks and smells real, and it rapidly melts away into nothing if touched or moved.

### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is buried in one of the graves. For each grave the characters dig up, there's a cumulative 10 percent chance of finding the treasure.


## G. Tser Pool Encampment

The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.

The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.

The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest's edge.

The eight draft horses drinking from the river are used to pull the Vistani wagons and aren't easily startled.
If the characters are brought to this camp by the Vistani, their escorts remain at the camp and don't accompany the adventuring party any farther.
Twelve Vistani (male and female human bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire, telling stories and guzzling wine. They are intoxicated and have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. Three sober Vistani (male and female human bandit captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.

Although the Vistani in this camp are in league with Strahd, they attack only if the characters provoke them with threats or insults. Otherwise, the characters are offered flasks of wine and invited to join the reverie.

If the characters linger at the camp, continue with "A Vistana's Tale" below. If they seem in a hurry to leave, one of the Vistani tells them, "It was fated that you would visit our humble camp. Madam Eva foretold your coming. She awaits you." The Vistana then points to the largest tent. If the characters head that way, continue with "Madam Eva's Tent."

### A Vistana's Tale

If the characters linger by the fire, one of the Vistani recounts the following tale:

A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse. "When the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.
"The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard's magic couldn't save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard's body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away."

The Vistana storyteller doesn't remember the wizard's name, but recalls that it sounded important. If the characters haven't spoken with Madam Eva, the storyteller urges them to do so.


### Madam Eva's Tent

If the characters decide to see Madam Eva, read:

Magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior of this tent, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. "At last you have arrived!" Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips.

Madam Eva (see appendix D) speaks the name of each party member and makes some reference to that individual's past deeds. She then asks the characters if they want their fortunes read. If they say yes, Madam Eva produces a worn deck of cards and proceeds with the sequence outlined in chapter 1. (If the characters don't want a reading of their fates, continue play using the card reading you performed before starting the adventure.)

Madam Eva might seem mad, but she is, in fact, cunning and sharp of mind. She has met a good many adventurers in her time and knows they can't be fully trusted. She wants to free the land of Barovia from its curse, and her fate is interwoven with Strahd's (see appendix D for details). She does th

%% --- Page 48 --- %%
vampire's bidding when called upon and does nothing to anger Strahd or bring harm to the Vistani. She never gives aid and never asks for any.


### Treasure 

For each Vistani tent or wagon that the characters search, roll once on the following table to determine what treasure is found:

| d20     | Treasure                                                                                                       |
|:------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $1-10$  | None                                                                                                           |
| $11-13$ | Sack of 100 ep (each coin stamped with Strahd's visage in profile)                                             |
| $14-16$ | Pouch containing 4d6 gemstones worth 100 gp each                                                               |
| $17-19$ | Sack containing 3d6 pieces of cheap jewelry worth 25 gp total and 1d6 pieces of fine jewelry worth 250 gp each |
| 20      | One magic item (roll once on Magic Item Table B in the Dungeon Master's Guide)                                 |


### Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading reveals that a treasure is here, it is hidden in one of the Vistani wagons. Madam Eva grants the characters permission to search the wagons if they ask, and any such search yields the treasure.

## H. Tser Falls

If the characters reach area $H$ by following the footpath from the Vistani encampment (area G), read:

You follow the river to the base of a canyon, at the far end of which a great waterfall spills into a pool, billowing forth clouds of cold mist. A great stone bridge spans the canyon nearly one thousand feet overhead.

If the characters are on the high road instead, read:

You follow the dirt road as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of mold-encrusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog-shrouded pines that blanket the valley.

The chasm's walls are slippery and sheer, and can't be scaled without the aid of magic or a climber's kit.
The bridge is slick with moisture but safe to cross. The road south of the bridge leads down the mountainside to area F; the road north cuts through the mountains to area I.

The gargoyles on the bridge are harmless sculptures.


## I. Black Carriage

Even here, in the mountains, the forest and the fog are inescapable. Ahead, the dirt road splits in two, widening toward the east. There you see patches of cobblestone, suggesting that the eastern branch was once an important thoroughfare.

If Strahd has invited the characters to Castle Ravenloft or otherwise wants to steer them in his direction, add:

[^0]
[^0]:    Parked at the fork in the road, pointed east, is a large black carriage drawn by two black horses. The horses snort puffs of steamy breath into the chill mountain air. The side door of the carriage swings open silently.

%% --- Page 49 --- %%
The two black draft horses are under Strahd's control. The horses wait for the characters to pile into the carriage if they so desire. There is room inside for eight of them. If they get into the carriage, the horses draw it down the road to area J. The horses can't be discouraged from their course, not even by a skilled teamster.

Characters who don't want to travel east in the carriage can follow the road northwest through a set of iron gates (area B) that open as they approach and close behind them, or the characters can travel south along the winding road to the bridge at Tser Falls (area H).
