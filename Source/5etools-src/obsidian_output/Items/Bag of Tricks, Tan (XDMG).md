# Bag of Tricks, Tan

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This bag made from tan cloth appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object.

You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling on the table below. See the [[Monster Manual|XMM]] for the creature's stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].

The creature is [[Friendly [Attitude]|XPHB]] to you and your allies, and it acts immediately after you on your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count. You can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn.
