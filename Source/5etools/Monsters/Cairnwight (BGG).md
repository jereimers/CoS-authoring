## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cairnwight makes two Slam attacks or two Rock attacks, and it uses its Petrifying Touch if available.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Petrifying Touch {@recharge 5}.** The cairnwight touches one creature it can see within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 26 (**4d12**) force damage and have the [[restrained]] condition as it begins to turn to stone. The affected target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target has the [[petrified]] condition instead of the [[restrained]] condition.
