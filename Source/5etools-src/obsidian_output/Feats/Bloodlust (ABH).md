# Bloodlust

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Powerful Recovery

When you roll a [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]] to regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]], you can treat any roll of 1 or 2 as a 3.

## Sanguine Feast

Once per turn when you hit a [[Bloodied]] creature that isn't a Construct or Undead with an attack roll, you can expend a [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]], roll it, and regain a number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the number rolled plus your Constitution modifier.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
