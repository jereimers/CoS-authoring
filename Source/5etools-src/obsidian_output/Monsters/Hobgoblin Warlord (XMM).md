## Traits

**Aura of Authority.** While in a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the hobgoblin, the hobgoblin and its allies have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls and saving throws, provided the hobgoblin doesn't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hobgoblin makes three attacks, using Javelin or Longsword in any combination.

**Javelin.** m,r +6, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) Piercing damage, and the target's [[Speed|XPHB]] decreases by 10 feet until the start of the hobgoblin's next turn.

**Longsword.** m +6, reach 5 ft. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) Slashing damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** @actTrigger The hobgoblin is hit by a melee attack roll while holding a weapon. @actResponse The hobgoblin adds 3 to its AC against that attack, possibly causing it to miss.
