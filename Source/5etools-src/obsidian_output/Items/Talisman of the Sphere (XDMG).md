# Talisman of the Sphere

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

While holding or wearing this talisman, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on any Intelligence ([[Arcana|XPHB]]) check you make to control a [[Sphere of Annihilation|XDMG]]. In addition, when you start your turn in control of a [[Sphere of Annihilation|XDMG]], you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to move it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier. This movement doesn't have to be in a straight line.
