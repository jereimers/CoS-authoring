## Traits

**Dimensional Lock.** Other creatures can't teleport to or from a space within 60 feet of the canoloth. Any attempt to do so is wasted.

**Magic Resistance.** The canoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The canoloth's weapon attacks are magical.

**Uncanny Senses.** The canoloth can't be [[surprised]] while it isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The canoloth makes two attacks: one with its tongue or its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h25 (**6d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Tongue.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d12 + 4**) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15), pulled up to 30 feet toward the canoloth, and is [[restrained]] until the grapple ends. The canoloth can grapple one target at a time with its tongue.
