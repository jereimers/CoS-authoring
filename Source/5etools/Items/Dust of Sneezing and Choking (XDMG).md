# Dust of Sneezing and Choking

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles [[Dust of Disappearance|XDMG]], and [[Identify|XPHB]] reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can throw the dust into the air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from you to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.

On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition and is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a [[Lesser Restoration|XPHB]] spell.
