## Traits

**Dreamwalker's Charm.** An enemy that starts its turn within 30 feet of the giant must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, provided that the giant isn't [[incapacitated]]. On a failed save, the creature is [[charmed]] by the giant. A creature [[charmed]] in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it succeeds on the saving throw, the creature is immune to this giant's Dreamwalker's Charm for 24 hours.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two Greatclub or Rock attacks.

**Greatclub.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h24 (**4d8 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Petrifying Touch.** The giant touches one Medium or smaller creature within 10 feet of it that is [[charmed]] by it. The target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes [[petrified]], and the giant can adhere the target to its stony body. [[greater restoration]] spells and other magic that can undo petrification have no effect on a [[petrified]] creature adhered to the giant unless the giant is dead, in which case the magic works normally, freeing the [[petrified]] creature as well as ending the [[petrified]] condition on it.
