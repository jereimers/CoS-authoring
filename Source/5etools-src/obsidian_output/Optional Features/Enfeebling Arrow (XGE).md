# Enfeebling Arrow

You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra **2d6** necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

The necrotic damage increases to **4d6** when you reach 18th level in this class.
