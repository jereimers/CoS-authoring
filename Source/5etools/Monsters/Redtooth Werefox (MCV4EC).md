## Actions

**Multiattack.** The werefox makes two Bite attacks, two Lance attacks, or one Bite attack and one Lance attack.

**Bite (Fox or Hybrid Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) piercing damage. If the werefox moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit and the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The werefox polymorphs into a fox-elf hybrid, into a fox, or back into its elf form. Its game statistics, other than its speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its elf form if it dies.

**Vulpine Nimbleness (Fox or Hybrid Form Only).** The werefox takes the Dash or Disengage action.
