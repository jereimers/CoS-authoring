## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the slithering tracker is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the slithering tracker move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the slithering tracker isn't a puddle.

**Liquid Form.** The slithering tracker can enter an enemy's space and stop there. It can also move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Spider Climb.** The slithering tracker can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) bludgeoning damage.

**Life Leech.** One Large or smaller creature that the slithering tracker can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [[grappled]] (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]] and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. In addition, the [[grappled]] target takes 16 (**3d10**) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The slithering tracker can grapple only one target at a time.

While grappling the target, the slithering tracker takes only half any damage dealt to it (rounded down), and the target takes the other half.


## Bonus Actions

**Watery Stealth.** If underwater, the slithering tracker takes the [[Hide]] action, and it makes the Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) check with advantage.
