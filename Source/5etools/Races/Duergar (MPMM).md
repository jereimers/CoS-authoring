## Creature Type

You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a dwarf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a dwarf.

## Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

## Duergar Magic

Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[enlarge/reduce]] spell on yourself with this trait, without requiring a material component. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [[invisibility]] spell on yourself with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.
