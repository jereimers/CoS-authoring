You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll an additional `d20` and choose which of the `d20`s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll a `d20` and choose which of the `d20`s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original `d20` roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional `d20` after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
