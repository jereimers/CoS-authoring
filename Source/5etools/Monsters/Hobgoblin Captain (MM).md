## Traits

**Martial Advantage.** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 10 (**3d6**) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hobgoblin makes two greatsword attacks.

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `d4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is [[incapacitated]].
