# Blade of Broken Mirrors (Dormant)

*Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement by a humanoid)*

A weapon of Tharizdun, this dagger is a piece of jagged stone whose blade is scribed with a maze-like pattern with no beginning or end.

## Sentience

The Blade of Broken Mirrors is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 21, a Wisdom of 24, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.

## Personality

An insane [[glabrezu]] named Ragazuu lives within the Blade of Broken Mirrors. The weapon yearns to cause chaos. It learns its wielder's principles, then uses those ideals to encourage reckless action. The dagger whispers ideas of revolution.

## Dormant

The dagger grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it returns to your hand.
- Whenever you kill a humanoid with an attack using the Blade of Broken Mirrors, the blade remembers the creature's appearance. While holding the dagger, you can use an action to change your form to match any humanoid the blade remembers. Your statistics, other than your size, don't change. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You can revert to your true appearance as an action. You revert to your true appearance automatically when you die. When the Blade of Broken Mirrors attunes to a new wielder, the appearances of humanoids it has killed are wiped from its memory.

> **Betrayer Artifact Properties**
> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property and one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property and an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg]] property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg]] property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.
