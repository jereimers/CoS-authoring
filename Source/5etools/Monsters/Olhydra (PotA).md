## Traits

**Empowered Attacks.** Olhydra's slam attacks are treated as magical for the purpose of bypassing resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Olhydra fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Olhydra has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Water Form.** Olhydra can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. She can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Olhydra makes two slam attacks or two water jet attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 19). Olhydra can grapple up to four targets. When Olhydra moves, all creatures she is grappling move with her.

**Water Jet.** Ranged Weapon Attack +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h21 (**6d6**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is knocked [[prone]] if it fails a DC 19 Strength saving throw.

**Summon Elementals (1/Day).** Olhydra summons up to three [[water elemental|]] and loses 30 hit points for each elemental she summons. Summoned elementals have maximum hit points, appear within 100 feet of Olhydra, and disappear if Olhydra is reduced to 0 hit points.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Crush.** One creature that Olhydra is grappling is crushed for 21 (**3d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Fling (Costs 2 Actions).** Olhydra releases one creature she is grappling by flinging the creature up to 60 feet away from her, in a direction of her choice. If the flung creature comes into contact with a solid surface, such as a wall or floor, the creature takes **1d6** bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was flung.

**Water to Acid (Costs 3 Actions).** Olhydra transforms her watery body into acid. This effect lasts until Olhydra's next turn. Any creature that comes into contact with Olhydra or hits her with a melee attack while standing within 5 feet of her takes 11 (**2d10**) acid damage. Any creature [[grappled]] by Olhydra takes 22 (**4d10**) acid damage at the start of its turn.
