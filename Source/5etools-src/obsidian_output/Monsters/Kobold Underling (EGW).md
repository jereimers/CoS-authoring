## Traits

**Messy End.** The kobold explodes 3 rounds after it dies, or immediately if it was killed by a critical hit. The explosion destroys the kobold's body, leaving its equipment behind. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding kobold must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (**1d8**) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Pack Tactics.** The kobold has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kobold's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Hand Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.
