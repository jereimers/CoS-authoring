# Healer

You gain the following benefits.

## Battle Medic

If you have a [[Healer's Kit|XPHB]], you can expend one use of it and tend to a creature within 5 feet of yourself as a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action. That creature can expend one of its [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]], and you then roll that die. The creature regains a number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the roll plus your [[Proficiency|XPHB]].

## Healing Rerolls

Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] you restore with a spell or with this feat's Battle Medic benefit, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.
