# Wildstorm

Areas of unstable magic can spin into small, translucent tornadoes called wildstorms. A wildstorm fills a 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. It has a Speed of 50 feet. Each round on Initiative count 0 (losing ties), a wildstorm moves toward the nearest creature and stops in its space. A wildstorm dissipates after `1d4` minutes.

A creature that enters a wildstorm for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is subjected to a random effect on the Wildstorm Effects table.

**Wildstorm Effects**

| 1d20 | Effect |
|---|---|
| 1–2 | The wildstorm becomes momentarily incendiary around the creature. The creature takes 2 (`1d4`) Fire damage and is burning. |
| 3–6 | Shards of magical force whirl past the creature. The creature makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (`1d10`) Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 7–10 | The wildstorm momentarily manifests toxic vapors around the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. If the creature already has the Poisoned condition, it instead takes 5 (`2d4`) Poison damage. |
| 11–13 | The creature hears mental cacophony and makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, taking 5 (`1d10`) Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Whether the saving throw succeeds or fails, the creature gains telepathy with a range of 10 feet for 1 minute. |
| 14–17 | The storm renders the creature more susceptible to its other erratic effects. The creature has Vulnerability to Fire, Force, Poison, and Psychic damage for 1 minute. |
| 18–19 | The creature's skin hardens. The creature gains a +2 bonus to AC for 1 minute. |
| 20 | The creature has the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. |
