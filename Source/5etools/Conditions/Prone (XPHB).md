# Prone

While you have the Prone condition, you experience the following effects.

### Restricted Movement

Your only movement options are to [[Crawling|XPHB]] or to spend an amount of movement equal to half your [[Speed|XPHB]] (round down) to right yourself and thereby end the condition. If your [[Speed|XPHB]] is 0, you can't right yourself.

### Attacks Affected

You have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls. An attack roll against you has [[Advantage|XPHB]] if the attacker is within 5 feet of you. Otherwise, that attack roll has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]].
