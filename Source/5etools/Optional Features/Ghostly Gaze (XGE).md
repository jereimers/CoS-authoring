# Ghostly Gaze

As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have [[darkvision]] if you don't already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your [[concentration]] ends (as if you were [[concentration]] on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
