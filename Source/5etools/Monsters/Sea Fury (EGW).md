## Traits

**Amphibious.** The sea fury can breathe air and water.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the sea fury fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Multiattack.** The sea fury makes two attacks with its claws.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Death Glare.** The sea fury targets one [[frightened]] creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**As Water.** The sea fury transforms into a wave of foaming seawater, along with whatever it is wearing or carrying, and moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. While in this form, it can't be [[grappled]] or [[restrained]]. It reverts to its true form at the end of this movement.

**Fearsome Apparition (Costs 2 Actions).** The sea fury conjures an apparition of one of its dead sisters, which appears in an unoccupied space the sea fury can see within 30 feet of it. Enemies of the sea fury that can see the apparition must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of it until it vanishes at the end of the sea fury's next turn.

**Conjure Snakes (Costs 3 Actions).** The sea fury disgorges a [[swarm of poisonous snakes]], which occupies the same space as the sea fury, acts on its own initiative count, and attacks as directed by the sea fury. The sea fury can control up to three of these swarms at a time.
