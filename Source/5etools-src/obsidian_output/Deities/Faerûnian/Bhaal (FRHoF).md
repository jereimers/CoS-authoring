# Bhaal

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Bhaal is a god of murder who revels in violence and ritualistic killing. He lends power to those whose slaughters invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal inspires fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death. He is a member of a trio of deities known as the Dead Three alongside Bane and Myrkul.

Bhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his manifested form. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form: a hulking figure armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this hairless form, he wears only a tattered loincloth and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood. When he sends emissaries to carry his word, he usually tasks a [[Doppelganger|XMM]] in the guise of someone the recipient later learns was dead during the conversation, or he sends a vicious [[Mezzoloth|XMM]].

While the folk of Faerûn don't normally pray to Bhaal, some propitiate him when they want to commit murder. A person might have an understandable reason to resort to murder, such as when they're unable to redress an injustice through lawful means, but it's far more common for prayers to Bhaal to be uttered by murderers motivated by jealousy, greed, or wrath. It's rare for anyone but assassins or compulsive killers to take Bhaal as a patron.

Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each led by a charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but organized worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely uncommon. Temples and shrines are similarly rare. Those who erect a shrine to Bhaal usually do so to thank him for a successful murder. Such shrines feature a skull or a severed head surrounded by drops of blood (both from the murdered victim). As with the other members of the Dead Three, Bhaal's cult has infiltrated [[Baldur's Gate|FRHoF]] on the [[Sword Coast|FRHoF]], where a vast temple to the Lord of Murder is said to brood in the tunnels beneath the city.

Chosen of Bhaal are blood-soaked terrors with little or no capacity for empathy. Their divine gifts hone their killing skills to a razor's edge.
