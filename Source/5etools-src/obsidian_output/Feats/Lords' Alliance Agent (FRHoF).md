# Lords' Alliance Agent

You gain the following benefits.

## Inspiring Strike

Once per turn when you score a [[Critical Hit|XPHB]] against a creature, you can choose an ally within 30 feet of yourself who can see or hear you and who lacks [[Heroic Inspiration|XPHB]]. That ally gains [[Heroic Inspiration|XPHB]].

## Reassert Honor

When an enemy you can see deals damage to an ally of yours that is within 5 feet of you, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on your next attack roll against that enemy before the end of your next turn.
