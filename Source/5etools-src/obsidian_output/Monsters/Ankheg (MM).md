## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the [[grappled]] creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.

**Acid Spray {@recharge}.** The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature [[grappled]]. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
