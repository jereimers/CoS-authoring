## Traits

**Invisible in Fire.** The oread is [[invisible]] while fully immersed in fire.

**Magic Resistance.** The oread has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The oread attacks twice with its fiery touch or fire bolt.

**Fiery Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) fire damage.

**Fire Bolt (Cantrip).** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d10**) fire damage.



## Reactions

**Hellish Rebuke (2nd-Level Spell; 1/Day).** When the oread is damaged by a creature within 60 feet of the oread that it can see, the creature that damaged the oread must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (**3d10**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
