## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) slashing damage.

**Breath Weapons {@recharge 5}.** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

- **Cold Breath:** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (**12d8**) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Paralyzing Breath:** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
