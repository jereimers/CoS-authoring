# Boon of Energy Resistance

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Energy Resistances

You gain [[Resistance|XPHB]] to two of the following damage types of your choice: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Poison, Psychic, Radiant, or Thunder. Whenever you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you can change your choices.

## Energy Redirection

When you take damage of one of the types chosen for the Energy Resistances benefit, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to direct damage of the same type toward another creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't behind [[Cover|XPHB]]. If you do so, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or take damage equal to `2d12` plus your Constitution modifier.
