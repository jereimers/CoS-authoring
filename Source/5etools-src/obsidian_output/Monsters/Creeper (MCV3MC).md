## Traits

**Bizarre Physiology.** The creeper can't take actions except for [[Dash]], [[Disengage]], [[Hide]], and [[Search]]. It can't take bonus actions or reactions.

**Creeper Head.** When a creeper drops to 0 hit points from a charged creeper's explosion (see the Destruction trait), it dies and its head falls off. A creeper's fallen head is hollow and can be worn as a mask with eye and mouth openings.

**Destruction.** When it ends its turn within 10 feet of a Humanoid that it can see, the creeper stops moving and emits a hiss loud enough to be heard by creatures within 30 feet of itself.

If the creeper drops to 0 hit points before the start of its next turn, the hissing stops, and the creeper dies. Otherwise, at the start of the creeper's next turn, one of following things happens:

- If there are no Humanoids within 10 feet of the hissing creeper, it stops hissing. It then uses any available movement to approach the nearest Humanoid it can see.
- If there are one or more Humanoids within 10 feet of the hissing creeper, the creeper explodes in a ball of energy that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. This energy spreads around corners. The creeper is destroyed, and every other creature in the explosion's area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (**4d6**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Increase this damage by 7 (**2d6**) if the creeper is charged (see "Electrical Charge" below). Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take 14 (**4d6**) lightning damage, or 21 (**6d6**) lightning damage if the creeper is charged.

**Electrical Charge.** Whenever the creeper is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead becomes charged for 1 minute. While charged, the creeper emits dim blue light in a 5-foot radius.

**Fear of Felines.** The creeper has the [[frightened]] condition whenever it starts its turn within 60 feet of a feline creature it can see. The condition lasts until the start of the creeper's next turn.
