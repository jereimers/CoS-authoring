## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).** If the dracolich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The dracolich has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Soul Gem.** The dracolich has a magical gem. If the dracolich is destroyed while the gem is on the same plane of existence as it, the dracolich gains a new body in `1d20` days, regaining all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] and appearing within 5 feet of the gem.

The gem is a Tiny object that has AC 20; HP 50; and [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage. The gem regains all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] at the end of every turn, but it turns to dust if reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. If the gem is destroyed, the dracolich can create a new one by completing an 8-hour ritual using a gem worth 1,000+ GP and by expending 5,000 GP, which the ritual consumes.
