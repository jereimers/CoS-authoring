# Mind Crystal (Heightened)

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This gemstone contains a crystallized bit of spellcasting magic.

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action while holding the mind crystal, you can modify the spell in the way described below. You can use only a single mind crystal to modify the spell, and you can't use a mind crystal and a Metamagic option on the same spell. Once you use the mind crystal, it becomes a nonmagical gem worth 50 gp.

## Modify Spell

Choose one creature affected by the spell. That creature has disadvantage on the first saving throw it makes against the spell.
