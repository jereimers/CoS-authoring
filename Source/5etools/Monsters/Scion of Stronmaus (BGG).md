## Traits

**Flyby.** The scion doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Legendary Resistance (6/Day).** If the scion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The scion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The scion deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The scion makes one attack using Lightning Sword or Hailstone, as well as two Slam attacks.

**Lightning Sword.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h36 (**4d12 + 10**) force damage plus 22 (**4d10**) lightning damage.

**Hailstone.** Ranged Weapon Attack +18 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. @h32 (**4d10 + 10**) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (**4d8**) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 26 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h36 (**4d12 + 10**) force damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Vengeful Storm {@recharge}.** The scion conjures a churning storm cloud in a 30-foot-radius, 10-foot-tall cylinder centered on a point within 120 feet of itself. The cloud's area is heavily obscured. The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until the scion dies, or when the scion uses this bonus action again.

When the cloud appears, and as a bonus action on later turns, the scion can move the cloud up to 30 feet and cause one of the following effects in a 30-foot-radius, 120-foot-high cylinder directly below it; the scion can't choose the same effect two rounds in a row:

**Acid Rain.** The cloud rains acid. Each creature in the cylinder must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or be covered in acid for 1 minute or until a creature uses its action to remove the acid from itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes 26 (**4d12**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Freezing Storm.** Shards of ice pelt down, and freezing wind fills the area. Each creature in the cylinder must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 28 (**8d6**) cold damage and be hindered by ice formations for 1 minute or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0.

**Lightning Bolts.** Bolts of lightning strike down. Each creature in the cylinder must succeed on DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (**4d8**) lightning damage and have the [[stunned]] condition until the end of its next turn.
