## Traits

**Nimble Escape.** Krenko can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of his turns.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Krenko makes two attacks with his scimitar.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) slashing damage plus 2 (**1d4**) poison damage..

**Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Redirect Attack.** When a creature Krenko can see targets him with an attack, Krenko chooses another goblin within 5 feet of him. The two goblins swap places, and the chosen goblin becomes the target instead.
