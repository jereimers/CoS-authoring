# K58. Bridge

A strong wind blows across this slender bridge of stone and masonry. The bridge's old iron railings have rusted away years ago, leaving the bridge without handholds.

The bridge connects areas K20 and K57. The wind isn't strong enough to knock creatures off the bridge, but a creature that takes damage while standing on the bridge must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall 60 feet onto the roof of the keep.
