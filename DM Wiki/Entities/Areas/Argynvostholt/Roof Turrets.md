# Q47. Roof Turrets

Cobwebs hang from the rafters of this turret, which is empty except for a wooden bench and an iron stove. Arrow slits look down upon the foggy grounds in front of the mansion.

The knights who once guarded the rooftop used these turrets for warmth and shelter on rainy days and cold nights.
