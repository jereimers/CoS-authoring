## Traits

**Dark One's Own Luck (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** When the warlock makes an ability check or saving throw, it can add a `d10` to the roll. It can do this after the roll is made but before any of the roll's effects occur.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The warlock makes three Scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) fire damage.

**Hellfire.** Green flame explodes in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 120 feet of the warlock. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (**3d10**) fire damage and 11 (**2d10**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Fiendish Rebuke (3/Day).** In response to being damaged by a visible creature within 60 feet of it, the warlock forces that creature to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
