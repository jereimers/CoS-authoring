# Blinding Smite

*3rd-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra **3d8** radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the spell ends.

A creature [[blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [[blinded]].
