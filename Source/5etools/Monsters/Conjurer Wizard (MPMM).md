## Actions

**Multiattack.** The conjurer makes three Arcane Burst attacks.

**Arcane Burst.** Attack (ms,rs) +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h19 (**3d10 + 3**) force damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Benign Transportation {@recharge 4}.** The conjurer teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see. If it instead chooses a space within range that is occupied by a willing Small or Medium creature, they both teleport, swapping places.

**Summon Elemental (1/Day).** The conjurer magically summons an [[air elemental]], an [[earth elemental]], a [[fire elemental]], or a [[water elemental]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the conjurer, whom it obeys. It takes its turn immediately after the conjurer. It lasts for 1 hour, until it or the conjurer dies, or until the conjurer dismisses it as a bonus action.
