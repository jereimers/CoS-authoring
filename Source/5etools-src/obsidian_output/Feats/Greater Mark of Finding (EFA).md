# Greater Mark of Finding

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Improved Intuition

When you use the Hunter's Intuition benefit of your [[Mark of Finding|EFA]] feat, you can roll `1d6` instead of `1d4`.

## Improved Finding

When you use the Finder's Magic benefit of your [[Mark of Finding|EFA]] to cast [[Hunter's Mark|XPHB]] without a spell slot, the range of the spell is doubled, and you can modify the spell so that the target can't benefit from the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition for the duration.
