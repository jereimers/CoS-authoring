- **Elemental Compulsion:** While wearing the ring, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.
