## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Darien can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet

**Eldritch Mind.** Darien has advantage on Constitution saving throws that she makes to maintain [[concentration]] on a spell.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Darien makes two War Pick attacks.

**War Pick.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) piercing damage plus 4 necrotic damage.

**Eldritch Blast.** Ranged Spell Attack +8 to hit, range 300 ft., three targets. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) force damage.

**Create Thrall.** Darien touches an [[incapacitated]] Humanoid. That creature is then [[charmed]] by her until a [[remove curse]] spell is cast on it, the [[charmed]] condition is removed from it, or she uses this feature again. Darien can communicate telepathically with the [[charmed]] creature as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence.

**Summon War Pick.** Darien creates a magical war pick in her empty hand. The war pick counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The war pick has a +1 bonus to attack and damage (already factored into Darien's attacks).



## Reactions

**Shield of Cryonax (1/Day).** When Darien takes damage, she can entomb herself in ice, which melts away at the end of her next turn. She gains 150 temporary hit points, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible. Immediately after she takes the damage, she gains vulnerability to fire damage, her speed is reduced to 0, and she is [[incapacitated]]. These effects, including any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the ice melts.
