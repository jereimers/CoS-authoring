# Planar Key

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This key is etched with sigils.

A planar key begins existence with `1d4 + 1` charges and cannot regain charges. When the key's last charge is expended, the key's sigils and magic fade away, but the key remains.

While touching the key, you can use your action to expend 1 charge and have the key cast [[plane shift]] limited to the key's predefined destination only. Each planar key links to a single destination defined when the key is made.
