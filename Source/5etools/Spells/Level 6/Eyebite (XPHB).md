# Eyebite

*6th-level necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

For the duration, your eyes become an inky void. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a save against this casting of the spell.

## Asleep

The target has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Panicked

The target has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition. On each of its turns, the [[Frightened|XPHB]] target must take the [[Dash|XPHB]] action and move away from you by the safest and shortest route available. If the target moves to a space at least 60 feet away from you where it can't see you, this effect ends.

## Sickened

The target has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition.
