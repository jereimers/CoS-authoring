## Actions

**Multiattack.** The roc makes two Beak attacks. It can replace one attack with a Talons attack.

**Beak.** m +13, reach 10 ft. @h28 (**3d12 + 9**) Piercing damage.

**Talons.** m +13, reach 5 ft. @h23 (**4d6 + 9**) Slashing damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 19) from both talons, and it has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the grapple ends.


## Bonus Actions

**Swoop {@recharge 5}.** If the roc has a creature [[Grappled|XPHB]], the roc flies up to half its [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] without provoking [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]] and drops that creature.
