## Traits

**Explosive Core.** When the spore is subjected to Fire damage, each creature in a 5-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the spore takes 7 (**2d6**) Fire damage.

**Rolling Mass.** The spore doesn't need to expend extra movement to move through [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spore makes four Tendril attacks. Alternatively, it makes two Tendril attacks and uses Consume once.

**Tendril.** m +10, reach 20 ft. @h11 (**1d10 + 6**) Piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) Acid damage. If the target is Large or smaller, the spore pulls the target 5 feet straight toward itself.

**Consume.** str DC 18, one Large or smaller creature within 5 feet. @actSaveFail The target is pulled into the spore's space and has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 16). Until the grapple ends, the target has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions, and it takes 17 (**5d6**) Acid damage at the start of each of the spore's turns. When the spore moves, the [[Grappled|XPHB]] target moves with it, costing it no extra movement. The spore can have one Large creature or up to nine Medium or smaller creatures [[Grappled|XPHB]] at a time.
