## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The steel predator has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The steel predator's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The steel predator makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claw.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d6 + 7**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) slashing damage.

**Stunning Roar {@recharge 5}.** The steel predator emits a roar in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (**5d10**) thunder damage, drops everything it's holding, and is [[stunned]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. The [[stunned]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
