## Traits

**Dreadful.** Bael can use a bonus action to appear dreadful until the start of his next turn. Each creature, other than a devil, that starts its turn within 10 feet of Bael must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] until the start of the creature's next turn.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Bael fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Bael has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** Bael's weapon attacks are magical.
