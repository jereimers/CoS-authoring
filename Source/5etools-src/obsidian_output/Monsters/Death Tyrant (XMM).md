## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).** If the death tyrant fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The death tyrant uses Eye Rays three times.

**Bite.** m +9, reach 5 feet. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) Piercing damage.

**Eye Rays.** The death tyrant randomly shoots one of the following magical rays at a target it can see within 120 feet of itself (roll `1d10`; reroll if the death tyrant has already used that ray during this turn):

- **1: Charm Ray:** wis DC 17. @actSaveFail 13 (**3d8**) Psychic damage, and the target has the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition for 1 hour or until it takes damage. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
- **2: Paralyzing Ray:** con DC 17. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
- **3: Fear Ray:** wis DC 17. @actSaveFail 10 (**3d6**) Psychic damage, and the target has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the end of its next turn. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
- **4: Slowing Ray:** con DC 17. @actSaveFail 18 (**4d8**) Necrotic damage. Until the end of the target's next turn, the target can't take Reactions; its [[Speed|XPHB]] is halved; and it can take either an action or a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] on its turn, not both. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
- **5: Enervation Ray:** con DC 17. @actSaveFail 16 (**3d10**) Poison damage, and the target has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition until the end of its next turn. While [[Poisoned|XPHB]], the target can't regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
- **6: Telekinetic Ray:** str DC 17 (the target succeeds automatically if it is Gargantuan). @actSaveFail The death tyrant moves the target up to 30 feet in any direction. The target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the start of the death tyrant's next turn or until the death tyrant has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a tool or opening a door or container.
- **7: Sleep Ray:** wis DC 17 (the target succeeds automatically if it is a Construct or an Undead). @actSaveFail The target has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. The condition ends if the target takes damage or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it.
- **8: Petrification Ray:** con DC 17. 1 The target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still [[Restrained|XPHB]], ending the effect on itself on a success. 2 The target has the [[Petrified|XPHB]] condition instead of the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition.
- **9: Disintegration Ray:** dex DC 17. @actSaveFail 36 (**8d8**) Force damage. If the target is a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force, a 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of it disintegrates into dust. @actSaveSuccess Half damage. @actSaveSuccessOrFail If the target is a creature and this damage reduces it to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it disintegrates into dust.
- **10: Death Ray:** dex DC 17. @actSaveFail 55 (**10d10**) Necrotic damage. @actSaveSuccess Half damage. @actSaveSuccessOrFail The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].


## Bonus Actions

**Negative Energy Cone.** The death tyrant's central eye emits an imperceptible, magical wave of negative energy in a 150-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Creatures in that area can't regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]] until the start of the death tyrant's next turn. An intact Humanoid corpse there instantly rises as a [[Zombie|XMM]] under the death tyrant's control and takes its turn immediately after the death tyrant on the same initiative count.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Chomp.** The death tyrant makes two Bite attacks.

**Glare.** The death tyrant uses Eye Rays.
