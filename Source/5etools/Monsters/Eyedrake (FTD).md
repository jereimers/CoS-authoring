## Traits

**Unusual Nature.** The eyedrake doesn't require food or drink.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Antimagic Breath {@recharge}.** The eyedrake emits a magic wave in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 39 (**6d12**) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Every spell of 3rd level or lower ends on creatures and objects of the eyedrake's choice in that area.

**Eye Rays.** The eyedrake shoots three of the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), each ray targeting one creature it can see within 60 feet of it:

- **1: Freezing Ray:** The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 17 (**5d6**) cold damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage with no additional effects.
- **2: Debilitating Ray:** The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) thunder damage and become [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn.
- **3: Repulsion Ray:** The target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) force damage and be pushed up to 60 feet away from the eyedrake.
- **4: Fire Ray:** The target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (**6d6**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **5: Paralyzing Ray:** The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **6: Death Ray:** The target must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (**8d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.
