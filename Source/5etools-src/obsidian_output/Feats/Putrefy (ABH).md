# Putrefy

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Necrosis

When you make a damage roll that deals Necrotic damage, you can cause one creature taking that damage to have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition until the start of your next turn. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
