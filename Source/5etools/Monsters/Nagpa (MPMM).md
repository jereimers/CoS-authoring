## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nagpa makes three Staff or Deathly Ray attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage plus 24 (**7d6**) necrotic damage.

**Deathly Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack +12 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h30 (**7d6 + 6**) necrotic damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Corruption.** The nagpa targets one creature it can see within 90 feet of it. The target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. An evil creature makes the save with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target is [[charmed]] by the nagpa until the start of the nagpa's next turn. On a successful save, the target becomes immune to the nagpa's Corruption for the next 24 hours.

**Paralysis {@recharge 6}.** The nagpa forces each creature within 30 feet of it to make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw, excluding Undead and Constructs. On a failed save, a target is [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. A [[paralyzed]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
