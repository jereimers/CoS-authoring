## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Luvash is a gruff, stubborn brawler with an impatient spirit and a heart of gold. To those he trusts, Luvash is a fiercely devoted father with a soft and gentle compassion—but near-overwhelmed by anxiety for the safety of his daughter.

### Morale
In a fight, Luvash would draw his blade to protect his people without a moment’s hesitation, but would swiftly sheathe it if necessary to keep [[Arabelle]] safe.

### Relationships
Luvash is the elder brother of Arrigal, one of Strahd’s spies. (Luvash doesn’t know that Arrigal is a spy for Strahd.) Luvash is also the father of [[Arabelle]], whose mother was one of Madam Eva’s descendants, and—along with Arrigal—one of the two leaders of the Vistani camp outside of Vallaki.

### Knowledge

- One day before the players’ arrival in Vallaki, Luvash’s nephew, Alexei, was tasked with watching [Arabelle](app://obsidian.md/Arabelle) play in the nearby woods while Luvash mediated a dispute between two Vistani families.
- Instead of watching [Arabelle](app://obsidian.md/Arabelle), Alexei got drunk on wine. When he woke up, [Arabelle](app://obsidian.md/Arabelle) was gone.
- Alexei claims that Yan, a long-time member of the encampment, gave him the wine and had vanished when Alexei awoke.
- Luvash led the search for [Arabelle](app://obsidian.md/Arabelle), joining more than a dozen Vistani and nearly that many dusk elf scouts from the hovels below the hill. Luvash himself had to return to the encampment after his right leg was caught in a wolf trap, leaving him too wounded to walk.
- The search parties haven’t yet found [Arabelle](app://obsidian.md/Arabelle). However, a dusk elf named Savid found Yan’s decapitated body lying in bloody grass near the Luna River, surrounded by signs of a fight.
- Savid also found a strange signet ring lying in the grass, which seemed to have been dropped in the struggle. Luvash gave it to Kasimir, the dusk elves’ leader and foremost scholar, to identify, but hasn’t received any useful news or information.
