## Traits

**Unusual Nature.** The anhkolox doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The anhkolox makes two Claw attacks and one Entrapping Rend attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d10 + 6**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet in a horizontal direction of the anhkolox's choice.

**Entrapping Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h23 (**5d6 + 6**) piercing damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be trapped in the anhkolox's rib cage and [[grappled]] (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the anhkolox can't use Entrapping Rend on another target.
