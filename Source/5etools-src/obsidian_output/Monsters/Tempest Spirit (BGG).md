## Traits

**Incorporeal Movement.** The spirit can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The spirit takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the spirit fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spirit makes two Lightning Fist or Hailstone attacks in any combination.

**Lightning Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h25 (**4d8 + 7**) lightning damage.

**Hailstone.** Ranged Weapon Attack +12 to hit, range 90/180 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d6 + 7**) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (**2d6**) cold damage.

**Death Bolt {@recharge 5}.** The spirit hurls a magical lightning bolt in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (**6d8**) lightning damage plus 16 (**3d10**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a success or failure, an affected creature's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.


## Bonus Actions

**Hailstorm {@recharge 4}.** The spirit conjures a hailstorm in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (**3d6**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) cold damage and has the [[prone]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
