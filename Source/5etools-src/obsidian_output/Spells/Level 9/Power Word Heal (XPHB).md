---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S

A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. If the creature has the [[Charmed|XPHB]], [[Frightened|XPHB]], [[Paralyzed|XPHB]], [[Poisoned|XPHB]], or [[Stunned|XPHB]] condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition, it can use its [[Reaction|XPHB]] to stand up.
