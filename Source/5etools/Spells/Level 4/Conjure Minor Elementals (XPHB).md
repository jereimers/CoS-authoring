# Conjure Minor Elementals

*4th-level conjuration*

---

**Range:** {'type': 'emanation', 'distance': {'type': 'feet', 'amount': 15}}  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure spirits from the Elemental Planes that flit around you in a 15-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] for the duration. Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals an extra **2d8** damage when you hit a creature in the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. This damage is Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning (your choice when you make the attack).

In addition, the ground in the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]] for your enemies.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `2d8` for each spell slot level above 4.
