# Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting

**Class:** [[Paladin]]  
**Level:** 2

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
