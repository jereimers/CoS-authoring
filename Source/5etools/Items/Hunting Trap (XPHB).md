# Hunting Trap

*Item, None*

As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can set a Hunting Trap, which is a sawtooth steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take **1d4** Piercing damage and have its [[Speed|XPHB]] reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 Piercing damage to the trapped creature.
