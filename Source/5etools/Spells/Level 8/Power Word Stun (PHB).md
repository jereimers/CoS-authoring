# Power Word Stun

*8th-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [[stunned]]. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [[stunned]] target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
