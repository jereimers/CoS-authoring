## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The achaierai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The achaierai makes two attacks with its Talons and one attack with its Beak.

**Beak.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Spring Attack.** The achaierai takes the Disengage action.


## Reactions

**Defensive Cloud.** After taking damage the achaierai can use its reaction to release a cloud of poisonous gas in a 10-foot-radius. All creatures in the cloud take 7 (**2d6**) poison damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] the target is confused as if from a [[confusion]] spell. At the end of its turns, the affected target can repeat the Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds the confusion ends. Achaierai are immune to the effects of this cloud.
