## Traits

**Unarmored Defense.** While the adept is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The adept makes three Unarmed Strike attacks or five Dart attacks.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage. Once per turn, the adept can cause one of the following additional effects (choose one or roll a `d4`):

- **1–2: Knock Down.:** The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
- **3–4: Push.:** The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet directly away from the adept.

**Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the adept deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 3`. If the damage is reduced to 0, the adept catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and the adept has a hand free.
