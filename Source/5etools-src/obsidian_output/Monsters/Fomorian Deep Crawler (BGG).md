## Traits

**Contortionist.** The fomorian can enter a space large enough for a Large creature without squeezing.

**Crawling Stance.** While the fomorian has the [[prone]] condition, crawling does not cost it extra movement. In addition, the [[prone]] condition does not grant advantage on attack rolls against the fomorian.

**Spider Climb.** The fomorian can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The fomorian makes two Slam attacks and uses Crawling Hex if it is available.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.

**Crawling Hex {@recharge 4}.** The fomorian targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 31 (**7d8**) psychic damage, have the [[prone]] condition, and become cursed for 1 hour. While cursed this way, the target can't stand up and end the [[prone]] condition on itself.
