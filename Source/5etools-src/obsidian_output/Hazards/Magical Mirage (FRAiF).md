# Magical Mirage

Magical mirages are created by ambient magic. Such a mirage seems real, including sounds and smells appropriate to the thing depicted, but it can't deal damage or cause conditions. Physical inspection of the mirage reveals it to be an illusion, for things can pass through it.

For example, a magical mirage might depict an oasis complete with local flora and fauna, but a creature wading into the oasis's pond would find only a sandy pit.

Examples of magical mirages include lively oases, and pristine ancient temples.

## Seeing through a Mirage

As a [[Study|XPHB]] action, a creature can inspect the image and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([[Investigation|XPHB]]). If a creature discerns the mirage's nature, the mirage becomes faint to the creature.
