## Traits

**Blurred Movement.** Attack rolls against the quickling have disadvantage unless it is [[incapacitated]] or its speed is 0.

**Evasion.** If the quickling is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails, provided it isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Multiattack.** The quickling makes three Dagger attacks.

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d4 + 6**) piercing damage.
