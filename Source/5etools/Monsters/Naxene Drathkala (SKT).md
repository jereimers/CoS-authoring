## Traits

**Roleplaying Information.** Goldenfields' crops are vital Waterdeep's survival, which is why the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors sent Naxene to make sure the temple-farm is adequately defended. At first she regarded the task as a punishment, but now she appreciates the peace and quiet.

Ideal: "There's no problem that can't be solved with magic."

Bond: "I have great respect for Lady Laeral Silverhand of Waterdeep. She and the Lords' Alliance are going to bring some much-needed order to this lawless land."

Flaw: "I'm too smart to be wrong about anything."


## Actions

**Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack +1 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h2 (**1d6 - 1**) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (**1d8 - 1**) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
