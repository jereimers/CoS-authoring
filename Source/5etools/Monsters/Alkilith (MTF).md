## Traits

**Amorphous.** The alkilith can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**False Appearance.** While the alkilith is motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary slime or fungus.

**Foment Madness.** Any creature that isn't a demon that starts its turn within 30 feet of the alkilith must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw, or it hears a faint buzzing in its head for a moment and has disadvantage on its next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.

If the saving throw against Foment Madness fails by 5 or more, the creature is instead subjected to the [[confusion]] spell for 1 minute (no [[concentration]] required by the alkilith). While under the effect of that confusion, the creature is immune to Foment Madness.

**Magic Resistance.** The alkilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The alkilith makes three tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h18 (**4d6 + 4**) acid damage.
