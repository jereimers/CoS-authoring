## Traits

**Deathly Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the zombie must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (**2d8**) poison damage and be [[poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

**Unusual Nature.** The zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The zombie makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.

**Flesh Entomb {@recharge 5}.** The zombie flings a detached clump of corpses at a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 16 (**3d10**) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Large or smaller creature, it becomes entombed in dead flesh.

A creature entombed in the dead flesh is [[restrained]], has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the dead flesh, and takes 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can be freed if the dead flesh is destroyed. The dead flesh is a Large object with AC 10, 25 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
