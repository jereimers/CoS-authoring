# Circle of Death

*6th-level necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth 500+ GP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

Negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] from a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **8d8** Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `8d8` for each spell slot level above 6.
