Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects (choose for each creature):

- The creature has [[Immunity|XPHB]] to the [[Charmed|XPHB]] and [[Frightened|XPHB]] conditions until the spell ends. If the creature was already [[Charmed|XPHB]] or [[Frightened|XPHB]], those conditions are suppressed for the duration.
- The creature becomes [[Indifferent [Attitude]|XPHB]] about creatures of your choice that it's [[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB]] toward. This indifference ends if the target takes damage or witnesses its allies taking damage. When the spell ends, the creature's attitude returns to normal.
