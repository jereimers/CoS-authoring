Your strike rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the target takes an extra **2d6** Thunder damage from the attack. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and have the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.

The damage increases by `2d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
