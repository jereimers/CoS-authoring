# Nonmagical Mirage

Nonmagical mirages range from simple illusions—such creating the appearance of shimmering water a few miles away—to complex illusions that mimic towering monsters lumbering across the horizon. Nonmagical mirages make no sound and move out of reach if approached.

Examples of nonmagical mirages include distant shimmering water, far-off dragons, or floating lights.
