## Traits

**Spider Climb.** The gem stalker can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Unusual Nature.** The gem stalker doesn't require food or drink.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The gem stalker makes four Claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Crystal Dart.** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) force damage, and one of the following effects occurs, determined by the kind of dragon that created the gem stalker:

**Amethyst.** The gem stalker can teleport to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it.

**Crystal.** The gem stalker gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt.

**Emerald.** The target must roll a `d4` and subtract the number rolled from the next attack roll it makes before the start of the gem stalker's next turn.

**Sapphire.** The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed horizontally up to 10 feet away from the gem stalker and be knocked [[prone]].

**Topaz.** The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the gem stalker's next turn.


## Reactions

**Protective Link.** When another creature the gem stalker can see within 30 feet of it is about to take damage, the gem stalker reduces that damage by 10 (`3d6`). The gem stalker then takes damage equal to that amount.
