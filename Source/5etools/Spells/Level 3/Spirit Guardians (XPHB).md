# Spirit Guardians

*3rd-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** {'type': 'emanation', 'distance': {'type': 'feet', 'amount': 15}}  
**Components:** V, S, M (a prayer scroll)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's [[Speed|XPHB]] is halved in the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]], and whenever the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes **3d8** Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or **3d8** Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d8` for each spell slot level above 3.
