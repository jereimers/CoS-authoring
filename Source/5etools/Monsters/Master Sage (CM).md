## Actions

**Shocking Grasp (Cantrip).** Melee Spell Attack +8 to hit (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal), reach 5 ft., one creature. @h13 (**3d8**) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

**Lightning Eruption (3/Day).** The sage creates an eruption of magical lightning centered on a point it can see within 150 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (**8d6**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Shield (1st-Level Spell; 3/Day).** When the sage is hit by an attack or targeted by a [[magic missile]] spell, it calls forth an [[invisible]] barrier of magical force that protects it. Until the start of its next turn, the sage has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and it takes no damage from magic missile.
