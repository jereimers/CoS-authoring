## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Brahma has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put her to sleep.

**Taunt (2/Day).** Brahma can use a bonus action to target one creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can hear Brahma, it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of Brahma's next turn.


## Actions

**War Lute.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Song of Domination (3/Day).** Brahma targets one creature that can see or hear her, which must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[charmed]] by her for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. It has disadvantage on these saves if being [[charmed]] by Brahma is something the target openly or secretly desires. For 1 hour after the charm effect ends, the target has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks made as part of a contest with Brahma.
