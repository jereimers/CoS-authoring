# Dragonborn (Gem)

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Gem Ancestry

You have a gem dragon ancestor, granting you a special magical affinity. Choose one kind of dragon from the Gem Ancestry table. This determines the damage type for your other traits, as shown in the table.

**Gem Ancestry**

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|---|---|
| Amethyst | Force |
| Crystal | Radiant |
| Emerald | Psychic |
| Sapphire | Thunder |
| Topaz | Necrotic |

## Breath Weapon

When you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes **1d10** damage of the type associated with your Gem Ancestry. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. This damage increases by **1d10** when you reach 5th level (**2d10**), 11th level (**3d10**), and 17th level (**4d10**).

You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Draconic Resistance

You have resistance to the damage type associated with your Gem Ancestry.

## Psionic Mind

You can send telepathic messages to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand these messages, but it must be able to understand at least one language to comprehend them.

## Gem Flight

Starting at 5th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest spectral wings on your body. These wings last for 1 minute. For the duration, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
