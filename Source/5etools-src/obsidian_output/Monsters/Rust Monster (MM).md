## Traits

**Iron Scent.** The rust monster can pinpoint, by scent, the location of ferrous metal within 30 feet of it.

**Rust Metal.** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the rust monster corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Non magical ammunition made of metal that hits the rust monster is destroyed after dealing damage.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 1**) piercing damage.

**Antennae.** The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn't being worn or carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the rust monster's touch.

If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn or carried, it takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.
