You conjure a group of intangible, orderly spirits that appear as a Medium group of modrons or other Constructs in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The spirits last for the duration. When you cast this spell and as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action on subsequent turns, you can command the spirits to target one creature or object you can see within 5 feet of the spirits and create one of the following effects:

- **Clockwork Force:** The target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **3d6** Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Orderly Ward:** The target gains [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to `1d6` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

When you move on your turn, you can also move the spirits up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage and [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] both increase by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 3.
