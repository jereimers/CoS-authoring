## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ziraj makes three attacks with his glaive or with his oversized longbow.

**Glaive.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Oversized Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Ziraj exudes magical menace. Each enemy within 30 feet of him must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute of Ziraj. If a [[frightened]] enemy ends its turn more than 30 feet away from Ziraj, the enemy can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
