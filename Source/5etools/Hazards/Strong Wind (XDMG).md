# Strong Wind

Strong wind imposes [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on ranged attack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall.

A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]]) checks.
