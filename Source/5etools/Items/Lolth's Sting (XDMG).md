# Lolth's Sting

*Item, None*

A creature subjected to Lolth's Sting must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition for 1 hour. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more, the creature also has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition while [[Poisoned|XPHB]] in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
