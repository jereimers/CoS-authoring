## Traits

**Firearms Knowledge.** The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of any firearm.

**Headfirst Charge.** If the giff moves at least 20 feet in a straight line and ends within 5 feet of a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [[prone]].

**Siege Monster.** The giff deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giff makes two Greatsword or Musket attacks.

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Musket.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d12 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Thunder Bomb.** The giff lights a grapefruit-sized bomb and throws it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (**4d8**) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the bomb, roll a `d6`; on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more bombs to throw.
