## Actions

**Multiattack.** The thri-kreen makes two Gythka attacks or four Psychic Bolt attacks.

**Gythka.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d8 + 1**) slashing damage.

**Psychic Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) psychic damage.

**Drain Vitality (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The thri-kreen targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 32 (**5d12**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The thri-kreen regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.


## Bonus Actions

**Chameleon Carapace.** The thri-kreen changes the color of its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings, gaining advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks it makes to hide in those surroundings.
