# Fate Cutter Shears

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

The blades of these pruning shears bear many nicks and dents but still cut cleanly. The shears function as a magic dagger. The weapon has the following properties:

- **Ever Sharp:** When you hit with an attack using the shears, the target takes an extra **1d6** force damage.
- **Sever Threads:** When you hit a creature with the shears, you can cut that creature's fate. Until the target finishes a long rest, attack rolls against it score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the `d20`. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
