## Traits

**Draconic Transformation.** When Dagryn drops to 0 hit points, instead of falling [[unconscious]], he transforms into his dragon form. He immediately gains all the statistics of an [[adult black dragon]] with the exception that his size is Medium, and has the [[stunned]] condition. At the start of his next turn, he grows to Large size, but remains [[stunned]]. At the start of his subsequent turn, Dagryn grows to Huge size and is no longer [[stunned]]. Dagryn remains in his dragon form for 24 hours whereupon he reverts to this stat block.

**Dwarven Resilience.** Dagryn has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being [[charmed]] or [[paralyzed]].


## Actions

**Club.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) bludgeoning damage.

**Eruption.** Ranged Spell Attack +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d10 + 3**) acid damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Dagryn magically turns [[invisible]] for 1 hour or until he attacks or casts a spell. Any equipment Dagryn wears or carries turns [[invisible]] with him.
