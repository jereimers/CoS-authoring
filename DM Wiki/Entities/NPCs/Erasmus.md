# Who They Are

Erasmus is a ghost who exists in the [[Ethereal Plane]]. He has been watching over [[Stella Wachter]]'s trapped soul and protecting her from the dark entities that haunt the Ethereal realm.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Victor Vallakovich]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

## The Frost Message

- Several weeks ago, Victor awoke to find a message written in frost on his bedroom window: "**Help Victor**"
- The message appeared during the night with no explanation
- Victor initially dismissed it as a prank or his imagination
- Only later did he realize the message might have been from someone trying to reach him from the [[Ethereal Plane]]

## Protecting Stella

- Erasmus exists as a ghost in the Ethereal Plane
- He has been protecting [[Stella Wachter]]'s soul from a "gallows speaker"—a dark shadow entity that feeds on souls
- Erasmus observed the teleportation accident that trapped Stella's soul and has been watching over her ever since
- He appears to have some connection or concern for Victor, enough to try to contact him for help
- Through Erasmus's protection, Stella has survived for two months in the Ethereal Plane when she should have faded in hours or days

## Communication with Victor

- Victor has learned to communicate with Erasmus through magical means
- Erasmus relays information about Stella's condition and the dangers she faces in the Ethereal Plane
- He has been observing events in both the material world and the Ethereal Plane, including:
  - The [[Night Hags|night hag]] [[Morgantha]] haunting the [[Refugee Camp]]
  - The state of Stella's trapped soul
  - The shadow entities threatening her

## Appearance

Based on Victor's descriptions of their communications, Erasmus appears as a ghostly figure visible only from the Ethereal Plane.

# Significance

Erasmus represents a mysterious ally who has:
- Reached out to Victor for help despite the difficulty of crossing planar boundaries
- Protected Stella from destruction at great personal effort
- Provided crucial intelligence about the Ethereal Plane and how to rescue Stella
- Demonstrated knowledge of both arcane matters and local events

His motivations for protecting Stella and contacting Victor remain unclear to the party.

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#A Breakfast of Borscht|Session 13]] — Victor revealed the frost message and Erasmus's role in protecting Stella's soul
- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Victor's Workroom|Session 13]] — Victor explained how Erasmus has been communicating with him about Stella's condition
