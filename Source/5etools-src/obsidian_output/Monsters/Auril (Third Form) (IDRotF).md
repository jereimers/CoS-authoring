## Traits

**Divine Being.** Auril can't be [[surprised]] and can't be changed into another form against her will.

**Divine Resurrection.** When Auril drops to 0 hit points, her crystalline form shatters and her divine spark vanishes. She is dead until the next winter solstice, when she reappears at full health in a cold, remote location of her choosing.

**Frigid Aura.** So long as Auril has at least 1 hit point in this form, each creature within 10 feet of her takes 10 cold damage at the start of each of her turns.

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day in This Form).** If Auril fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Auril has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unusual Nature.** Auril doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Auril uses Polar Ray twice.

**Polar Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack +13 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h14 (**4d6**) cold damage.

**Blizzard Veil.** Auril creates a magical blizzard in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on herself. The area within the sphere is heavily obscured, and the sphere moves with Auril. The effect lasts until Auril drops to 0 hit points in this form, until she chooses to end the effect (no action required), or until her [[concentration]] is broken (as if [[concentration]] on a spell).




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Polar Ray.** Auril uses Polar Ray.

**Intensify Aura (Costs 2 Actions).** Auril's Frigid Aura deals an extra 10 cold damage until the end of her next turn.

**Blinding Gleam (Costs 2 Actions).** Auril's form flares with a blue light. Each creature that can see Auril and is within 10 feet of her must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be [[blinded]] by Auril's magical gleam for 1 minute. The [[blinded]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
