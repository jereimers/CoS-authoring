# Pale Tincture

*Item, None*

A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (**1d6**) Poison damage and have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition. The [[Poisoned|XPHB]] creature repeats the save every 24 hours, taking 3 (**1d6**) Poison damage on a failed save. The damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means while the creature remains [[Poisoned|XPHB]]. After seven successful saves against the poison, the creature is no longer [[Poisoned|XPHB]].
