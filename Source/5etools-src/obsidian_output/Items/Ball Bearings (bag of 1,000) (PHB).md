# Ball Bearings (bag of 1,000)

*Item, None*

As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level area 10 feet square. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall [[prone]]. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.
