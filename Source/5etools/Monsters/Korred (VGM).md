## Traits

**Command Hair.** The korred has at least one 50-foot-long rope woven out of its hair. As a bonus action, the korred commands one such rope within 30 feet of it to move up to 20 feet and entangle a Large or smaller creature that the korred can see. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or become [[grappled]] by the rope (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends. the target is [[restrained]]. The korred can use a bonus action to release the target, which is also freed if the korred dies or becomes [[incapacitated]].

A rope of korred hair has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point at the start of each of the korred's turns while it has at least 1 hit point and the korred is alive. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

**Stone Camouflage.** The korred has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.

**Stone's Strength.** While on the ground, the korred deals 2 extra dice of damage with any weapon attack (included in its attacks).
