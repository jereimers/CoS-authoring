## Traits

**Mental Fortitude.** The hatchling has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]] or [[frightened]], and magic can't put the hatchling to sleep.

**Spider Climb.** The hatchling can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
