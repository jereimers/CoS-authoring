# Lunging Attack

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can expend one Superiority Die and take the [[Dash|XPHB]] action. If you move at least 5 feet in a straight line immediately before hitting with a melee attack as part of the [[Attack|XPHB]] action on this turn, you can add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll.
