## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The witchstalker has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Smell Magic.** The witchstalker can sense the presence and location of magic within 120 feet of itself. It also has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have cast a spell since the end of the witchstalker's last turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The witchstalker makes two Bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Mind-Wracking Howl {@recharge 5}.** The witchstalker unleashes a terrible howl, and each creature within 30 feet of it that isn't a Monstrosity must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 24 (**7d6**) psychic damage and has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain [[concentration]] on spells until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.



## Reactions

**Spell Stalk.** Immediately after a creature within 120 feet of the witchstalker casts a spell, the witchstalker magically teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the creature and can make one Bite attack against the creature.
