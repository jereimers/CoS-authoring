## Traits

**Nilbogism.** Any creature that attempts to damage the nilbog must first succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be [[charmed]] until the end of the creature's next turn. A creature [[charmed]] in this way must use its action praising the nilbog. The nilbog can't regain hit points, including through magical healing, except through its Reversal of Fortune reaction.

**Nimble Escape.** The nilbog can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.


## Actions

**Fool's Scepter.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Reversal of Fortune.** In response to another creature dealing damage to the nilbog, the nilbog reduces the damage to 0 and regains `1d6` hit points.
