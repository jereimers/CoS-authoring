# Boots of Striding and Springing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

While you wear these boots, your [[Speed|XPHB]] becomes 30 feet unless your [[Speed|XPHB]] is higher, and your [[Speed|XPHB]] isn't reduced by you carrying weight in excess of your carrying capacity or wearing Heavy Armor.

Once on each of your turns, you can jump up to 30 feet by spending only 10 feet of movement.
