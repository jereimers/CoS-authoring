## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The ceremorph has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 9) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [[stunned]] until this grapple ends.

**Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [[incapacitated]] humanoid [[grappled]] by the ceremorph. @h55 (**10d10**) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the ceremorph kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

**Laser Pistol.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. @h12 (**3d6 + 2**) radiant damage.

**Mind Blast {@recharge 5}.** The ceremorph magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (**4d8 + 4**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
