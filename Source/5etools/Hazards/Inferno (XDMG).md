# Inferno

Whenever an uncontrolled fire spreads, it can create an inferno that quickly engulfs creatures, objects, and vegetation.

An inferno consists of at least four contiguous 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of fire. Each of the inferno's 10-foot Cubes can be doused with 10 gallons of water. Exposure to a strong wind for 1 minute causes the inferno to grow, adding `1d4` new 10-foot Cubes to its volume. An inferno deprived of fuel burns itself out after `1d10` minutes.

An inferno damages any vegetation or object that isn't being worn or carried that it touches, dealing 22 (**4d10**) Fire damage immediately and again at the end of each minute. Any creature that enters the inferno for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (**4d10**) Fire damage and is burning.
