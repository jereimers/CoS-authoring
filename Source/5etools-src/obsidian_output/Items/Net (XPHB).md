# Net

*Item, None*

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a Net. Target a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or have the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it is Huge or larger.

To escape, the target or a creature within 5 feet of it must take an action to make a DC 10 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check, freeing the [[Restrained|XPHB]] creature on a success. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.
