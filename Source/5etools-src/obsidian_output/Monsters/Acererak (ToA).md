## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Acererak carries the [[Staff of the Forgotten One|ToA]]. He wears a [[Talisman of the Sphere]] and has a [[Sphere of Annihilation]] under his control.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Acererak fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Rejuvenation.** Acererak's body turns to dust when he drops to 0 hit points, and his equipment is left behind. Acererak gains a new body after `1d10` days, regaining all his hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of Acererak's phylactery, the location of which is hidden.

**Turn Resistance.** Acererak has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.


## Actions

**Paralyzing Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**3d6**) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Staff (+3 Quarterstaff).** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage, or 8 (**1d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage when used with two hands.

**Invoke Curse.** While holding the Staff of the Forgotten One, Acererak expends 1 charge from it and targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or be cursed. Until the curse is ended, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. [[Greater restoration]], [[remove curse]], or similar magic ends the curse on the target.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**At-Will Spell.** Acererak casts one of his at-will spells.

**Melee Attack.** Acererak uses Paralyzing Touch or makes one melee attack with his staff.

**Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).** Acererak fixes his gaze on one creature he can see within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. The [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target its immune to Acererak's gaze for the next 24 hours.

**Talisman of the Sphere (Costs 2 Actions).** Acererak uses his [[Talisman of the Sphere]] to move the [[Sphere of Annihilation]] under his control up to 90 feet.

**Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature within 20 feet of Acererak must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 42 (**12d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
