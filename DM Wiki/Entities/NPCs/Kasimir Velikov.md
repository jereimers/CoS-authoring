# Kasimir Velikov Profile

## Portrait
![[kasimir-velikov.png]]

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Kasimir should make the players feel grateful for his competence and genuine interest in assisting them, mildly insulted by his slight condescension, mildly suspicious of his caginess, and sympathetic to his sorrow for the plight of his people.

### Emotions
Kasimir most often feels curious, frustrated, suspicious, excited, melancholy, nostalgic, somber, or regretful.

### Motivations
Kasimir wants to ensure the safety of the dusk elves and resurrect his sister, Patrina, once he’s freed her of Strahd’s dark influence and seen Strahd destroyed.

### Inspirations
When playing Kasimir, channel Stephen Strange (*Doctor Strange*), Sherlock Holmes (*Sherlock*), Spock (*Star Trek*), and the Twelfth Doctor (*Doctor Who*).

## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Kasimir is a quiet and withdrawn scholar, with a powerful curiosity and a fierce dedication to his people. To those he trusts, Kasimir is a lost and broken man, guilt-ridden for his role in Patrina’s death and resigned to somber despair for the dusk elves’ future. Only Kasimir knows the lengths to which he is willing to go to resurrect his sister—and the price he is willing to pay.

### Morale
In a fight, Kasimir would attempt to negotiate a peace, but would not hesitate to unleash his most powerful spells—or use his magic to escape—if a diplomatic solution proved untenable.

### Relationships
Kasimir is the leader of the dusk elf encampment and the younger brother of the late Patrina Velikovna, a **banshee** who resides in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft. Kasimir is also the cousin of [[Rahadin]], Strahd’s chamberlain, and the nephew of the late dusk elf prince, Erevan Löwenhart. (Kasimir is not a direct blood relation of Erevan, who married Kasimir’s aunt, Lorelei.)
