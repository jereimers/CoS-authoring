# Bile Lichen

Bile lichen is a toxic, green-yellow substance resembling vomit. It flourishes where extreme heat and cold mingle, such as at the steam-vent openings to Icewind Dale's Underdark. One patch of bile lichen covers a 5-foot square.

If a patch of bile lichen is touched, it releases a cloud of spores that fills a 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] and dissipates after `1d4` hours. When a creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (`2d10`) Poison damage and contracting [[Lichen Plague|FRAiF]] on a failed save (see "[[Magical Contagions|FRAiF]]" later in this chapter). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.
