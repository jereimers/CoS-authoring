## Actions

**Multiattack.** Sildar makes two Longsword attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 1**) slashing damage, or 6 (**1d10 + 1**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d10**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** When an attacker Sildar can see would hit him with a melee attack, he can roll a `d6` and add the number rolled to his AC against the triggering attack, provided he's wielding a melee weapon.
