# Instrument of the Bards, Anstruth Harp

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement by a bard)*

An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take **2d4** Psychic damage.

You can play Anstruth Harp to cast one of the following spells: [[Fly|XPHB]], [[Invisibility|XPHB]], [[Levitate|XPHB]], [[Protection from Evil and Good|XPHB]], [[Cure Wounds|XPHB]] (level 5), [[Ice Storm|XPHB]], and [[Wall of Thorns|XPHB]]. Once the Anstruth Harp has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
