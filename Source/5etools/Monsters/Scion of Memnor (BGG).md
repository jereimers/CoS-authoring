## Traits

**Flyby.** The scion doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Legendary Resistance (6/Day).** If the scion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The scion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Siege Monster.** The scion deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The scion makes one attack using Cloud Morningstar or Wind Javelin, as well as two Slam attacks.

**Cloud Morningstar.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h32 (**4d10 + 10**) force damage plus 22 (**4d10**) thunder damage.

**Wind Javelin.** Ranged Weapon Attack +18 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. @h42 (**5d12 + 10**) thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 26 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d8 + 10**) force damage.

**Thunderous Vortex {@recharge 5}.** The scion magically creates a vortex of wind in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in the sphere must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close as possible to the center. Then a burst of thunder erupts in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the same point. Each creature in that area takes 52 (**8d12**) thunder damage and must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition until the end of its next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Fog of Deception.** The scion conjures a magical cloud that fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 90 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has the [[charmed]] condition until the end of its next turn. While it has the [[charmed]] condition, the creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself of the scion's choice. If no creature is within its reach, the affected creature makes a ranged attack against a creature of the scion's choice, throwing its weapon if necessary. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the scion's Fog of [[Deception]] for the next 24 hours.
