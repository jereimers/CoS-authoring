## Traits

**Aura of Protection.** Ramius and any ally that starts their turn within 30 feet of him have a +4 bonus to all saving throws and resistance to nonmagical damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ramius makes two Longsword attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. @h10 (**1d8 + 6**) slashing damage or 11 (**1d10 + 6**) if wielded in two hands, plus 13 (**3d8**) radiant damage. If the target is an evil creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or take an additional 13 (**3d8**) radiant damage.

**Divine Wave {@recharge}.** Ramius strikes the ground and causes holy energy to radiate outwards. Each creature of his choice within 30 feet of him must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Targets take 21 (**6d6**) thunder damage plus 21 (**6d6**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save are knocked down (have the [[prone]] condition).



## Reactions

**Healing Touch.** As a reaction to Ramius or an adjacent creature taking 50 points or more of damage, Ramius reaches out and channels divine energy, healing 13 (`2d8 + 4`) hit points.
