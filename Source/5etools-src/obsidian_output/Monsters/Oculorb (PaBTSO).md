## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The oculorb has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Watchful Eyes.** The oculorb has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The oculorb makes two Dreadful Contact attacks or four Eye Beam attacks.

**Dreadful Contact.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) psychic damage, or 25 (**6d6 + 4**) psychic damage if the target has the [[frightened]] condition.

**Eye Beam.** Ranged Spell Attack +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) psychic damage.

**Antipathic Flood {@recharge 5}.** The oculorb releases a wave of negative emotions, choosing one of the following options:

**Weeping Eyes.** The oculorb weeps, releasing a wave of crushing despair. Each creature within 30 feet of the oculorb must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature's speed is reduced to 0 feet until the end of the oculorb's next turn, and if the creature was [[concentration]], its [[concentration]] is broken.

**Withering Glare.** The oculorb's eyes unleash furious scarlet energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (**6d10**) necrotic damage and has the [[frightened]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[frightened]]. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.



## Reactions

**Obsessive Rebuke.** When the oculorb is damaged by a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself, it forces the creature to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
