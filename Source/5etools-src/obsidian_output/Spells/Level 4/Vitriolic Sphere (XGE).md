*4th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of giant slug bile)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **10d4** acid damage and another **5d4** acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by `10d4` for each slot level above 4th.
