## Traits

**Amphibious.** The kraken can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kraken makes two attacks: one with its claw and one with its tentacles.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h30 (**6d6 + 9**) slashing damage.

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h30 (**6d6 + 9**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]].

**Lightning Strike {@recharge 5}.** The kraken hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (**12d8**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
