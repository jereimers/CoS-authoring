# Who They Were

King Barov von Zarovich II was the father of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and ruler of the kingdom of Old Zarovia. He was a conqueror who expanded his realm through brutal military campaigns.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Kasimir's Tale]], the party learned:

- King Barov demanded the [[Dusk Elves]]' fealty and tribute, seeking to expand the borders of Old Zarovia
- When [[Erevan Löwenhart]], leader of the dusk elves, refused to bow, Barov launched a war of conquest
- The war was swift and brutal, with Barov's forces—joined by [[Rahadin]], a dusk elf traitor—laying waste to the dusk elf kingdom of [[Othrondil]]
- Barov subjugated the dusk elves and ruled over them with an iron fist
- When Barov died, his son [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] came to power
- The dusk elves rose in rebellion against Strahd, hoping for freedom, but were crushed in a matter of days
- Strahd's genocide left fewer than a hundred dusk elves alive

# Legacy

King Barov's conquest of the dusk elves set the stage for centuries of suffering. His tyranny was continued—and exceeded—by his son Strahd, who transformed the conquered valley into a prison from which none can escape.

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Tea with Kasimir|Session 13]] — [[Kasimir Velikov]] told the party about King Barov von Zarovich II during [[Kasimir's Tale]]
