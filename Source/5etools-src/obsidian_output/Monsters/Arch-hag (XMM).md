## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day, or 5/Day in Lair).** If the hag fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The hag has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spiteful Escape.** When the hag drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it dies only if it is within 30 feet of its anathema (a thing the DM chooses as the hag's most hated thing). Otherwise, the hag drops to 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] and teleports to a harmless demiplane, and it can't return to the plane it left for `2d6` days. When the hag teleports away, each creature within 60 feet of the space it left is cursed. Until the curse ends, a creature has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on ability checks and saving throws, and the hag knows its location anywhere in the multiverse.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hag makes two Spectral Claw attacks and uses Crackling Wave.

**Spectral Claw.** m,r +14, reach 10 ft. or range 60 ft. @h17 (**3d6 + 7**) Force damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.

**Crackling Wave.** dex DC 22, each creature in a 60-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. @actSaveFail 32 (**5d12**) Lightning damage. @actSaveSuccess Half damage. @actSaveSuccessOrFail The target is cursed until the end of the hag's next turn. The target can't take Reactions until the curse ends.


## Bonus Actions

**Witch Strike.** Each creature cursed by the hag and within 60 feet of it takes 14 (**4d6**) Lightning damage.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Hag's Swipe.** The hag makes one Spectral Claw attack.

**Malicious Magic.** The hag uses Spellcasting to cast [[Dimension Door|XPHB]] or [[Hypnotic Pattern|XPHB]]. The hag can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.
