## Traits

**Amphibious.** The priest can breathe air and water.


## Actions

**Thunderous Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h27 (**5d10**) thunder damage.

**Voice of the Kraken (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** A kraken speaks through the priest with a thunderous voice audible within 300 feet. Creatures of the priest's choice that can hear the kraken's words (which are spoken in Abyssal, Infernal, or Primordial) must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
