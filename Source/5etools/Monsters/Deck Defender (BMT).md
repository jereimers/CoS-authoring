## Traits

**Allied Knight.** Some of the deck defender's statistics are based on the character who drew the Knight card. Where the deck defender stat block refers to "you," it refers to that character.

**Folded Versatility.** After finishing a long rest, you can refold the deck defender's shape, changing it to acrobat form, berserker form, or guardian form.

**Fragile.** If the deck defender is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses into a haphazard pile of nonmagical playing cards and can't be resurrected or reconstructed.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The deck defender makes a number of attacks equal to half its proficiency bonus (rounded down).

**Paper Cut.** Melee Weapon Attack PB + +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Reckless Strike (Berserker Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack PB + +3 to hit (with advantage), reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage, and attacks made against the deck defender until the start of its next turn have advantage.


## Bonus Actions

**Swift Step (Acrobat Form Only).** The deck defender takes the Dash or Disengage action.


## Reactions

**Protection (Guardian Form Only).** When a creature the deck defender can see attacks a target other than the deck defender and is within 5 feet of the deck defender, the deck defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.
