%% A session is a unit of play in which the players meet in person, enact one or more scenes/encounters, and then adjourn. Sessions have recaps and dates, and can span across boundaries of arc/act. %%

# A Breakfast of Borscht

- Arden went for an early morning walk, meeting Szoldar and Yevgeni on their way to check their traps
- The party was visited by Erasmus Van Richten's ghost in their room at the Blue Water Inn (see [[Arc H - The Lost Soul#H1. Erasmus' Plea]])
- They learned from Urwin that the "Victor" written on the window was likely to be the baron's son.
- They still have sneaky suspicions about Rictavio, but didn't have time to pursue.

# Visiting the Vistani

- Walking west along the Svalich Road then south via a wooded path, they beheld the Vistani Camp ringed by Dusk Elf hovels built into the hill
- They approached a Dusk Elf guard, Savid, and asked where they could find the Vistani girl for whom they carried a gift. Savid (the one who discovered Yan's body) winced and gave them a grim smirk before pointing them up the hill to the large central tent.
- Leaning in through the tent's open entryway, they beheld the scene described in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#Entering the Vistani Camp]]. They met Luvash and Arrigal, learned what he knows about his daughter's disappearance, and promised to help find Arabelle. Luvash told them to visit Kasimir to retrieve the signet ring and also told them where to find the presumed site of the abduction.

# Tea with Kasimir

- Met Kasimir Velikov. Arden used his Lay On Hands paladin ability to heal Kasimir's frostbitten hand. Kasimir told them he knew not what meaning the ring held, but knew the significance of the two symbols on its face (necromancy and evocation schools of magic). 
- Arden, interest piqued at meeting a new kind of elf he didn't know existed, asked Kasimir about the history of his people. The party sat down for storytime while Kasimir related his tale (see [[Kasimir's Tale]])
- Arden produced his [[Broken Blade]], prompting Kasimir to embrace him as family, as clearly the blade had chosen to find its way to the paladin for a reason. The two swore that the blade would bring vengeance to Rahadin and Strahd.

# CSI: Luna River

- Before returning to Vallaki, the foursome (plus Ireena) ventured further west to visit the site of Arabelle's disappearance. Passing through the [[Luna River Crossroads]], they were beset by twig blights and scarecrows (see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E5b. Luna River Crossroads]]), but dispatched them easily. 
- Reaching the riverside clearing where Yan's headless body lay, Fig did some solid investigatory work to piece together what had happened (see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#^Abstract-Tracking-Arabelle]] for details on what they learned). Climbing the tree where one set of footprints stopped, Fig found a torn shred of silk fabric on which Arden was able to detect a whiff of undead energy. The party recalled the visage of [[Escher]], Strahd's vampire spawn coachman whom they met at the [[River Ivlis Crossroads]] in [[Session 05 - Out of Barovia]] (see [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C2a. Strahd’s Arrival]] for description)

# Raiding the Vallakovich Library (Politely)

- Dropped off Ireena at the Church of St. Andral, then went to the Vallakovich Manor, where they were led up to the library by Claudia. Baron Vargas excused himself to "take the Barovians to the lake". Players perused the library, finding several interesting books including a biography of a long-dead and unknown king, an anthology of poetry, a guide to fine wines, and an epic novel entitled *Dungeon Crawler Karl*. Additionally, Fig examined a genealogical record of Vallakian births and deaths and learned a startling clue about Ireena's past: a death record dated about 18 years ago listed an "Ireena Strazni" having died of unknown causes (presumed devoured by wolves), followed soon thereafter by her parents Grygori and Fatima (suicide by hanging) and survived by her older brother Izek Strazni. 
- Amid this revelation, they were interrupted by Victor Vallakovich entering the library in search of a specific text, carrying his spellbook with him. He and the players quickly bonded over their shared contempt for the Baron (although Victor wasn't nearly as gung-ho about killing him as Arden was). 
- A two-part conversation ensued. Choppy noticed the symbol on Victor's spellbook, recognizing it as identical to the engraving on the signet ring, and began to question Victor about the book and the symbol's meaning. At the same time, Arden and Fig explained that they'd been tasked to help Victor by an incorporeal entity calling itself "Erasmus". Varnish also mentioned that they'd been tasked by Baron Vargas to investigate a haunting in the house.
- Though initially skeptical and reluctant to share details about his spellbook, Victor relented when he heard about the urgency of Arabelle's plight. He revealed that he'd found the spellbook several years ago in the library and had been using it to learn and hone his repertoire as a mage. 
- To the second inquiry, Victor grimaced at the mention of Erasmus' name and muttered that he "had the situation under control," but nonetheless welcomed the players' assistance. Before sharing more information, he requested the party join him in his attic workroom.

# Victor's Workroom

- Reaching the attic via pulldown trapdoor in the manor's master bedroom, the players found themselves in a storage space cluttered with generations of neglected aristocratic excess. Through the mountainous piles wove a narrow path along which Victor immediately departed, not waiting for the party behind him. 
- They followed him until they reached the end of the attic, finding a door bearing a painted skull and a sign reading "ALL IS NOT WELL." Victor held open the door (lest the players trigger the *glyph of warding* nested within the painted skull) and ushered the players into his workroom. (see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E3c. Speaking with Victor]])
- The workroom contained tables strewn with bits of parchment, a large wooden chest on which lazed a skeletal cat ("That's just Patches, he's a loaf," assured Victor), a floor length mirror in the corner, and a runic circle inscribed upon the floor.
- Attending first to the spellbook, Victor explained that: its original owner and author was a mage named Khazan; the symbol on the cover (and the ring) was his personal sigil; and Khazan built a wizard's tower that he imbued with powerful enchantments, including a protective field that prevented any other spellcasters from using magic within its presence. Once the players agreed to investigate the tower and deliver any artifacts found therein back to Victor, he revealed that the tower can be found at the end of a gravel causeway on Lake Baratok, west of Vallaki. He didn't know how to get to Lake Baratok, but recommended they speak with (or hire) Szoldar Szoldarovich, whom Victor had been forced by his father to accompany on a hunting trip just a year ago "in an effort to get him to be more manly." Victor hated the hunting trip, but came away with a healthy respect for the hunter's wilderness skills: Szoldar would definitely know how to reach the lake.
- Now to the second issue: the "help" for which Erasmus pleaded. Victor admitted, somewhat sheepishly, that he suspected what he was about to reveal would also shed light on the haunting his father mentioned. Then, turning his attention to the mirror in the corner, Victor asked the party not to panic or be angry or afraid, then spoke toward the mirror: "You can come out now." The spectral form of a teenage girl coalesced in the mirror, greeting the players with a shy wave but otherwise silent. This was Stella Wachter, explained Victor--the daughter of Lady Fiona who was rumored to be recently confined to her family's estate for mysterious reasons. 
- He then shared the story of their attempt to construct a teleportation circle via which they might be able to escape the horrors of Barovia, renewed since Strahd's awakening three months ago. Stella volunteered to test the prototype, but things went horribly wrong, resulting in Stella's soul being separated from her body and trapped in the Ethereal Plane, beset by dark shadows and fading gradually from any chance of return. That she's survived this far is only thanks to Erasmus' intervention. (See [[The Lost Soul]] for the story details). Victor had a plan to rescue Stella which involved transporting the group of them into the Ethereal Plane to reverse the botched teleportation ritual; the catch was that the means of accessing the Ethereal Plane required a Night Hag's *heartstone*. Luckily for Stella, but unluckily for most others, Erasmus has observed the hideous form of just such a creature visiting the [[Refugee Camp]] on several occasions.
- The way forward from here would require the party to revisit the [[Refugee Camp]] to investigate the foul presence, which they suspected was one-and-the-same with [[Morgantha]], the dream-pastry-peddling old woman.
# Dinner at Wachterhaus

- Apropos of everything, you remembered you were expected for dinner at [[Wachterhaus]] by invitation of Stella's mother herself and departed the Vallakovich Manor. 
- Greeted at the door by Haliq, Lady Wachter's valet, who ushered you inside with impeccable manners, leading you past the delicious aroma of roast lamb and stewed vegetables wafting from the kitchen before situating you in the house's stately parlor and then departing to fetch refreshments.
- You looked around a bit, but found nothing suspicious or out of the ordinary. You had a brief encounter with Stella's physical form, who stared catatonically before being escorted to the garden by her older brother Nikolai (but only after a kinda funny exchange between Nikolai and Arden hearkening back to [[Session 09 - Walls Keep Out More Than Wolves#Blue Water Inn|one of a growing number of Arden's Signature Throat Chops]]). 
- Enter [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]], who insisted Nikolai dress his sister warmly for her walk in the garden, then turned and greeted you with reserved, but warm, respect.
