# Fragment of Abhorrence

*Fragment Of Suffering*

## Benefit

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack roll, you can force the target to move up to 10 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. A creature that can't be [[frightened]] is immune to this effect.

## Drawback

If you start your turn [[frightened]], you take **2d6** psychic damage.
