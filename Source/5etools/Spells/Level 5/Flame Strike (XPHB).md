A vertical column of brilliant fire roars down from above. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on a point within range makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **5d6** Fire damage and **5d6** Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The Fire damage and the Radiant damage increase by `5d6` for each spell slot level above 5.
