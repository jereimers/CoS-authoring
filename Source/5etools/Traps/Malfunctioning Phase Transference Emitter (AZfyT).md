# Malfunctioning Phase Transference Emitter

The malfunctioning Phase Transference Emitter consists of two primary components. The power battery is a 10-foot circular matrix of conduction coils wired directly to a generator via a secure power cable. The coils have ten nodes that connect to a large eight-foot tall cylindrical steel emitter rigged on a swivel.
