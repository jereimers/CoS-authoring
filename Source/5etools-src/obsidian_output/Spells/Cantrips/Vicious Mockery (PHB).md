# Vicious Mockery

*Cantrip enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take **1d4** psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

This spell's damage increases by **1d4** when you reach 5th level (**2d4**), 11th level (**3d4**), and 17th level (**4d4**).
