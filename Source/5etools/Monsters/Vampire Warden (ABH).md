## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The vampire has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Vampire Weakness.** The vampire has these weaknesses:

- The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from an occupant.
- The vampire takes 20 Acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
- If a weapon that deals Piercing damage is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition, the vampire has the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition until the weapon is removed.
- The vampire takes 20 Radiant damage if it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls and ability checks.
- If the vampire drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] while it doesn't have the [[Petrified|XPHB]] condition, it turns to stone, regains 50 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], and has the [[Petrified|XPHB]] condition for 1 hour.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The vampire makes two Claw attacks and uses Bite or Guardian's Command.

**Claw.** m +9, reach 5 ft. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) Slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) Necrotic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 16) from one of two claws.

**Bite.** con DC 16, one creature within 5 feet that is willing or that has the [[Grappled|XPHB]], [[Incapacitated|XPHB]], or [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition. @actSaveFail 7 (**1d4 + 5**) Piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) Necrotic damage. The target's [[Hit Points|XPHB]] maximum decreases by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to that amount.



## Reactions

**Resilient Flesh.** @actTrigger The vampire is hit by a melee attack roll from an attacker the vampire can see. @actResponse The vampire reduces the damage it takes from the attack by 11 (`2d6 + 4`).
