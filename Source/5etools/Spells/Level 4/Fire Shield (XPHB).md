# Fire Shield

*4th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)  
**Duration:** 10 minutes

---

Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 10-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 10 feet.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes **2d8** Fire damage from a warm shield or **2d8** Cold damage from a chill shield.
