## Actions

**Multiattack.** The thri-kreen makes two Gythka or Chatkcha attacks.

**Gythka.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Chatkcha.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Chameleon Carapace.** The thri-kreen changes the color of its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings, gaining advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks it makes to hide in those surroundings.

**Leap.** The thri-kreen leaps up to 20 feet in any direction, provided its speed isn't 0.


## Reactions

**Parry.** The thri-kreen adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the thri-kreen must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
