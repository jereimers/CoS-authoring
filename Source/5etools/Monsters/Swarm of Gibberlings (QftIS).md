## Traits

**Aversion to Fire.** If the swarm takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

**Incessant Gibberish.** Any non-gibberling that is within 60 feet of the swarm and doesn't have the [[deafened]] condition has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain [[concentration]] on spells and similar effects.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough to accommodate a Small gibberling. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The swarm makes two Gnashing Teeth attacks.

**Gnashing Teeth.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. @h14 (**4d4 + 4**) piercing damage, or 9 (**2d4 + 4**) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
