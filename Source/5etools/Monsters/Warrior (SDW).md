## Traits

**Battle Readiness.** The warrior has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Improved Critical.** The warrior's attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the `d20`.

**Indomitable (1/Day).** The warrior can reroll a saving throw that it fails, but it must use the new result.

**Martial Role.** The warrior has one of the following traits of your choice:

- **Attacker:** The warrior gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls.
- **Defender:** The warrior gains the Protection reaction below.

**Second Wind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The warrior can use a bonus action on its turn to regain hit points equal to `1d10` + its level.


## Actions

**Extra Attack.** The warrior can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the attack action on its turn.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) slashing damage, or 9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Protection (Defender Only).** When a creature the warrior can see attacks a target other than the warrior that is within 5 feet of the warrior, the warrior can use their reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. The warrior must be wielding a shield.
