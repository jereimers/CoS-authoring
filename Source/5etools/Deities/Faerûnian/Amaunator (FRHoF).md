# Amaunator

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

The rule of law and the glory of the sun both fall in Amaunator's dominion. He is a stern and unforgiving god, concerned with keeping promises and maintaining order.

Amaunator's followers believe he has died and been reborn time and again. They quarrel with followers of Lathander over whether Lathander is an aspect of Amaunator or is a separate deity. Either way, Lathander represents the optimistic light of dawn, while Amaunator represents the sun in all aspects. At times, the sun is warm and encouraging; at others, harsh and unforgiving. What matters most is that it reliably rises each day and sets each night.

When Amaunator sends a messenger, its presence is unmistakable: a [[Couatl|XMM]] or a seemingly ordinary bird with gleaming eyes like miniature suns descends from the heavens in a shaft of bright light. Amaunator also communicates with his followers via dreams in which the darkness of night is suddenly vanquished by the broad daylight.

The folk of Faerûn invoke Amaunator's name when praying for sunny weather, swearing oaths, signing contracts, and declaring laws. The connection between a solemn oath and the light of the sun is ingrained in the people of Faerûn; those closing deals or issuing edicts often pause and wait for a passing cloud to clear the sun before completing the transaction or pronouncement.

Amaunator's priests help establish bureaucracies and order in communities. They witness contracts and signed agreements, signifying these documents' validity by stamping them with the god's sun symbol. Temples to Amaunator feature courtyards and skylights to invite the god's bright gaze. In underground settlements or places plagued by cloud cover, his temples mount a torch with a [[Continual Flame|XPHB]] spell cast on it over their doorway to symbolize the sun. Amaunator's temples keep extensive records of their surrounding community's laws and legal proceedings. Most temples make these records available to the public for transparency. In places where corruption has spread even to Amaunator's temples, access to these records cost a hefty sum.

The Chosen of Amaunator master magic that dispels darkness and unveils hidden truths. Some work to enforce the law across the land; others become magistrates in Faerûn's highest courts.
