## Traits

**Ethereal Jaunt.** As a bonus action, a xill can magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.

**Poison Stinger.** The xill injects poison into one creature it hit with its claws this turn. The chosen creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, with disadvantage if the xill hit it more than once this turn, taking 14 (**4d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] this way.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The xill makes four claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) piercing damage.
