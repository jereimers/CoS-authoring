# Ezmerelda's Wooden Stakes

## Description
[[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]] carries **three wooden stakes** as essential tools for her vampire-hunting profession. A wooden stake is the traditional means of permanently destroying a vampire—if driven through the heart of a vampire that is incapacitated in its coffin, the stake paralyzes the vampire until removed.

## Properties
- **Type:** Adventuring Gear / Improvised Weapon
- **Quantity:** 3
- **Rarity:** Common
- **Attunement:** No

## Usage Against Vampires
According to vampire lore and the stat block for vampires:

> **Stake to the Heart.** If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into a vampire's heart while it is incapacitated in its coffin, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

This is one of the key weaknesses of vampires, including [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich]].

## Notes
