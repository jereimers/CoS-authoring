# W12. Ramp

This turret has a sloping, wooden floor that spirals from the cellar to the upper levels. Scratch marks suggest that barrels are rolled up and down the ramp on a routine basis.

The spiraling ramp connects all three levels of the winery. The evil druids who have taken over the winery use this ramp to move between levels.
