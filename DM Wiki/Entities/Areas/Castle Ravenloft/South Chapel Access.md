# K17. South Chapel Access

<div class="description"><p>This arched room connects a vast chamber to the east and the landing of a staircase to the west. To the left of the landing, the stairs curl down into darkness. To the right, the stairs climb into thick drapes of cobwebs. Alcoves in the north and south walls hold eight-foot-tall sculptures of helmed knights with bright blades. Black shadows obscure their faces.</p></div>

The statues are harmless. The vast chamber to the east is the chapel (area K15). The staircase to the west is described in area K18.
