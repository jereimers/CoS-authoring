## Traits

**Searing Armor.** The razerblast's armor is hot. Any creature grappling the razerblast or [[grappled]] by it takes 5 (**1d10**) fire damage at the end of that creature's turn.

**Shrapnel Explosion.** When the razerblast drops to 0 hit points, a flaming orb in its chest explodes, destroying the razerblast's body and scattering its armor as shrapnel. Creatures within 10 feet of the razerblast when it explodes must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (**6d6**) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The razerblast makes three melee attacks.

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage, or 7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (**1d6**) fire damage.
