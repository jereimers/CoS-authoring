## Traits

**Amphibious.** The kuo-toa can breathe air and water.

**Otherworldly Perception.** The kuo-toa can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is [[invisible]] or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.

**Slippery.** The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kuo-toa makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its pincer staff.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Pincer Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the kuo-toa can't use its pincer staff on another target.
