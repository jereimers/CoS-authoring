# Who they are

Max is a scruffy, mist-touched dog who serves as [[The Grinch]]'s only companion. Despite his master's bitterness and cruelty, Max remains unfailingly loyal—wagging his tail at any kindness, following commands with anxious devotion, and sleeping at the Grinch's feet each night. He is thin, slightly mechanical in his movements (a consequence of the Grinch's tinkering), and has soulful brown eyes that seem to understand far more than a normal dog should.

# What the party knows

If the party has heard of the Grinch, they may have heard mention of "his wretched hound" or "the poor beast he keeps." Children in Vallaki sometimes claim to have seen a thin dog watching from the mountain's edge.

# Personality

Max is gentle, eager to please, and starved for affection. He is anxious around loud noises and sudden movements—a consequence of living with the Grinch's volatile moods. Despite this, he never cowers from his master and will defend the Grinch with his life. When shown kindness by strangers, Max responds with overwhelming gratitude: tail wagging, soft whines, and pressing his head against offered hands.

## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Max is the emotional heart of the Grinch encounter. Players should feel genuine affection for him and, through that affection, begin to see the Grinch differently. Max's love for his master—despite everything—should make players question whether the Grinch is truly irredeemable.

# Notes

- His purpose is emotional, not mechanical
- Harming Max should feel *wrong* to players
- The Grinch's love for Max is his one vulnerability and his one virtue
