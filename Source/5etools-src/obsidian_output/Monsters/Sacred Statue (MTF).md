## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the statue remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue.

**Ghostly Inhabitant.** The [[eidolon|MTF]] that enters the sacred statue remains inside it until the statue drops to 0 hit points, the eidolon uses a bonus action to move out of the statue, or the eidolon is turned or forced out by an effect such as the [[dispel evil and good]] spell. When the eidolon leaves the statue, it appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the statue.

**Inert.** When not inhabited by an [[eidolon|MTF]], the statue is an object.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The statue makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h43 (**6d12 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h37 (**6d10 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.
