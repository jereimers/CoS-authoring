## Traits

**Psychic Leech.** At the start of each of the Lonely's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.

**Thrives on Company.** The Lonely has advantage on attack rolls while it is within 30 feet of at least two other creatures. It otherwise has disadvantage on attack rolls.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The Lonely makes one harpoon arm attack and uses Sorrowful Embrace.

**Harpoon Arm.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. @h21 (**4d8 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15) if it is a Large or smaller creature.

The Lonely has two harpoon arms and can grapple up to two creatures at once.

**Sorrowful Embrace.** Each creature [[grappled]] by the Lonely must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. A creature takes 18 (**4d8**) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the Lonely pulls each creature [[grappled]] by it up to 30 feet straight toward it.
