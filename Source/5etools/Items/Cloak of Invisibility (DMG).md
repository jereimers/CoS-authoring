# Cloak of Invisibility

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you can pull its hood over your head to cause yourself to become [[invisible]]. While you are [[invisible]], anything you are carrying or wearing is [[invisible]] with you. You become visible when you cease wearing the hood. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

Deduct the time you are invisible, in increments of 1 minute, from the cloak's maximum duration of 2 hours. After 2 hours of use, the cloak ceases to function. For every uninterrupted period of 12 hours the cloak goes unused, it regains 1 hour of duration.
