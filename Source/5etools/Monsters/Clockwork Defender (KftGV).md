## Traits

**Unusual Nature.** The defender doesn't need air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Electrified Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) lightning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be [[grappled]] (escape DC 13). A creature [[grappled]] by the defender takes the damage again at the start of each of the defender's turns. The defender can have only one creature [[grappled]] in this way at a time, and the defender can't make Electrified Bite attacks while grappling.


## Bonus Actions

**Light Beam.** The defender emits bright light from its eyes in a 60-foot cone, or it shuts off this light.
