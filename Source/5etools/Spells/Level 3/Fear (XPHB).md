# Fear

*3rd-level illusion*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self (30-feet cone)  
**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

Each creature in a 30-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and have the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition for the duration.

A [[Frightened|XPHB]] creature takes the [[Dash|XPHB]] action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.
