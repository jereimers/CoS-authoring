## Traits

**Song of Rest.** The bard can perform a song while taking a short rest. Any ally who hears the song regains an extra `1d6` hit points if it spends any Hit Dice to regain hit points at the end of that rest. The bard can confer this benefit on itself as well.

**Taunt (2/Day).** The bard can use a bonus action on its turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear the bard, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of the bard's next turn.


## Actions

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.
