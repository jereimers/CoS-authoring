# Antigravity Belt

*Item, None*

Metal tubes ring the lower edge of this wide belt. It is powered by an [[energy cell]] stored in a metal case near the buckle. Placing a full [[energy cell]] in the belt gives the belt 10 charges.

## Activating the Belt

As a bonus action, you can expend any number of the belt's charges to activate it; the belt remains active for 1 minute per charge expended. You can use a bonus action to deactivate the belt early, but doing so doesn't recover any expended charges.

When you activate the belt, and as a bonus action while it remains active, you can rise or descend vertically up to 20 feet. You remain floating in place while the property is active, and you can move yourself horizontally by being pushed or towed or by scooting yourself along a surface, such as a wall or ceiling, at half your walking speed. If you are still levitating when the belt deactivates, you fall.

## Replacing the Energy Cell

While the belt has charges remaining, its [[energy cell]] can't be removed. Once the belt has 0 charges, you can replace the [[energy cell]] with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.
