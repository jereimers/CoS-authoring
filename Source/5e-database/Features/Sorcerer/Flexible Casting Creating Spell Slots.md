# Flexible Casting: Creating Spell Slots

**Class:** [[Sorcerer]]  
**Level:** 2

You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. 

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.
