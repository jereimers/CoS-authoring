# Fragment of Melancholy

*Fragment Of Suffering*

## Benefit

When you fail a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw, you can reroll it with advantage, potentially turning a failure into a success. After you use this benefit, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

## Drawback

If you use this fragment's benefit and it doesn't turn a failed saving throw into a success, you are [[incapacitated]] until the end of your next turn, overcome with despair.
