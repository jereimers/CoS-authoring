## Traits

**Transparent.** Even when an ooze-folk is in plain sight, it takes a DC 12 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check to spot an ooze-folk that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the ooze-folk's space while unaware of the ooze-folk is [[surprised]] by the ooze-folk.

**Fragile Bones.** For each 5 damage it takes, the ooze-folk's walking speed is reduced by 5 feet.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The ooze folk makes one glass longsword attack and one pseudopod attack.

**Glass Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) slashing damage. If a 1 is rolled on an attack roll with a glass longsword, it shatters and can no longer be used.

**Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) acid damage.
