# Trip Attack

When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]], you can expend one Superiority Die and add the die to the attack's damage roll. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.
