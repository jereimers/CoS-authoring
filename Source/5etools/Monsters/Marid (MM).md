## Traits

**Amphibious.** The marid can breathe air and water.

**Elemental Demise.** If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The marid makes two trident attacks.

**Trident.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) piercing damage, or 15 (**2d8 + 6**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Water Jet.** The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (**6d6**) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked [[prone]]. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked [[prone]].
