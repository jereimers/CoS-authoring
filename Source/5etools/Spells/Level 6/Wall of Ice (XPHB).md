You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking **10d6** Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] per 10-foot section, and it has [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and [[Vulnerability|XPHB]] to Fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.

A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **5d6** Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by `10d6` and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by `5d6` for each spell slot level above 6.
