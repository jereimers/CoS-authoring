## Traits

**Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

**Antimagic Susceptibility.** The armor is [[incapacitated]] while in the area of an [[antimagic field]]. If targeted by [[dispel magic]], the armor must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [[unconscious]] for 1 minute.

**False Appearance.** While the armor remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal suit of armor.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The armor makes two melee attacks or uses Shocking Bolt twice.

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) lightning damage.

**Shocking Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +4 to hit (with advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal), range 60 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d6**) lightning damage.
