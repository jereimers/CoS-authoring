## Traits

**False Object.** If the library is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the library move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check to discern that the library is animate.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The library makes two attacks.

**Chained Book.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 12).
