## Traits

**Brute.** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the bugbear hits with it (included in the attack).

**Surprise Attack.** If the bugbear surprises a creature and hits it with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an extra 7 (**2d6**) damage from the attack.

**Heart of Hruggek.** The bugbear has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], [[frightened]], [[paralyzed]], [[poisoned]], [[stunned]], or put to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The bugbear makes two melee attacks.

**Morningstar.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d8 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage in melee or 5 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage at range.
