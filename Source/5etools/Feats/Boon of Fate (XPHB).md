# Boon of Fate

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Improve Fate

When you or another creature within 60 feet of you succeeds on or fails a [[D20 Test|XPHB]], you can roll `2d4` and apply the total rolled as a bonus or penalty to the `d20` roll. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you roll [[Initiative|XPHB]] or finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
