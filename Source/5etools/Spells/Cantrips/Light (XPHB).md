# Light

*Cantrip evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)  
**Duration:** 1 hour

---

You touch one Large or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.
