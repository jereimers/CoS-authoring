# The Theft at Blinsky's Toys

A peculiar incident at [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky's]] toy shop—merchandise stolen, the workshop ransacked, and no clear culprit. The theft is an isolated event, not part of any larger conspiracy, but it provides a hook for investigating [[The Grinch]] and [[Mt Crumpit]].

## The Incident

### What Happened

Several nights before [[The Long Night]], [[Gadof Blinsky]] woke to find his shop violated:
- Toys stolen from shelves and storage
- Tools and materials taken from his workshop
- Festival decorations (commissioned by the Baron) missing
- Strange claw marks on the windowsill
- Muddy pawprints trailing toward the back door

Blinsky is distraught. The stolen goods represent weeks of work, and the Baron's decorations were already promised. Worse, some of the toys were meant as gifts for children—a rare act of genuine charity in Barovia.

### What Blinsky Knows

- The theft happened sometime after midnight
- He heard nothing—a remarkably quiet burglary
- The claw marks are unlike any animal he recognizes
- The pawprints are dog-like but "wrong somehow—too precise"
- He has heard children's stories about "the Green Man" but dismisses them as fantasy
- He is terrified the Baron will blame him for losing the decorations

### What Blinsky Suspects

Privately, Blinsky wonders if the theft is connected to the "creature on the mountain" that children whisper about. He won't voice this theory unprompted—it sounds ridiculous—but if pressed, he admits the claw marks match the stories.

## What the Party Knows

The party may learn of the theft through:
- Direct observation (seeing Blinsky's distress, the damaged shop)
- Rumor (townsfolk gossiping about the incident)
- Request (Blinsky asks the party for help recovering his goods)
- Baron's complaint (the burgomaster rages about missing decorations)

# The Theft at Blinsky's Toys

## Framing the Incident

**This is designed as an isolated incident, not a disruption to Arc G or Blinsky's role in the campaign.**

The theft:
- Does NOT destroy Blinsky's shop or put him out of business
- Does NOT alter his relationship with [[Izek Strazni]] or the Ireena dolls
- Does NOT affect any existing plot threads
- DOES provide a hook to investigate the Grinch
- DOES establish stakes for The Long Night

## What Actually Happened

[[The Grinch]] descended from [[Mt Crumpit]] in the dead of night, accompanied by [[Max]]. Using his artificer skills and natural stealth, he:
1. Disabled the simple lock on Blinsky's back door
2. Systematically collected toys, tools, and decorations
3. Loaded everything into a large sack
4. Left through the window when he heard Blinsky stirring upstairs
5. Fled back to Mt. Crumpit before dawn

**Motivation:** The Grinch targets Blinsky specifically because the toymaker represents everything he resents—someone who brings joy to others, who is part of a community, who creates rather than destroys.

## Investigation Clues

### At Blinsky's Shop

| Clue | DC | Information |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Claw marks on windowsill | DC 10 Perception | Present; unlike any common animal |
| Claw analysis | DC 14 Nature or Survival | Humanoid with claw-like nails, not a beast |
| Pawprints | DC 10 Perception | Dog-like, leading toward the back alley |
| Pawprint analysis | DC 14 Investigation | Unnaturally regular, almost mechanical |
| Lock examination | DC 12 Investigation | Picked, not forced; some skill required |
| Residue on floor | DC 15 Investigation | Faint frost residue, even indoors |
| Missing items pattern | DC 13 Insight | Thief prioritized symbolic items (toys, decorations) over valuables |

### Following the Trail

| Location | DC | Information |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Back alley | DC 12 Survival | Trail leads northwest, toward the town wall |
| Town wall | DC 14 Perception | Scuff marks where something climbed over |
| Outside wall | DC 12 Survival | Trail continues toward Mt. Crumpit |
| Trail quality | DC 14 Survival | Two sets of prints: humanoid and canine |

### Witness Accounts

- **Night watchman:** Saw nothing, but felt "watched" around midnight
- **Stray dog:** A local stray barked frantically around 2 AM; was found cowering the next morning
- **Child witness (optional):** A Vallakian child claims to have seen "a dog with glowing eyes" from their window

## Running the Investigation

### Structure

1. **Discovery:** The party learns of the theft (Blinsky's request, rumor, observation)
2. **Scene Investigation:** Examining Blinsky's shop for clues
3. **Trail Following:** Tracking the thief toward Mt. Crumpit
4. **Decision Point:** Confront the Grinch or gather more information

### Possible Outcomes

| Outcome | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Party investigates, finds Mt. Crumpit | Leads to main Grinch encounter |
| Party ignores the theft | The Long Night raid happens; stakes increase |
| Party guards Blinsky on Long Night | May catch the Grinch mid-raid |
| Party returns stolen goods | Blinsky is grateful; +1 to all Persuasion checks with Vallaki NPCs |

## Blinsky's Reward

If the party recovers his goods, Blinsky offers:
- 50 gp (his life savings, offered tearfully)
- A custom Blinsky toy for each party member (macabre but oddly charming)
- Free repairs to any equipment (his skills are modest but sincere)
- A letter of recommendation to the Baron (of dubious value)
- Eternal gratitude and friendship

## Connecting to Other Events

### The Long Night
The theft is a prelude to the Grinch's main raid on The Long Night. If the party investigates the theft, they may:
- Prevent the raid entirely by confronting the Grinch beforehand
- Set a trap during The Long Night, knowing who to expect
- Understand the Grinch's pattern and predict his movements

### Arc G (Strazni Siblings)
**This event does NOT affect Arc G.** The Ireena dolls are not taken; Izek's arrangement with Blinsky continues undisturbed. The Grinch is unaware of and uninterested in Strazni family drama.

## Tone Notes

The theft should feel:
- **Mysterious:** Who would steal toys? Why?
- **Slightly whimsical:** The claw marks, the pawprints, the frost—it's almost fairy-tale
- **Grounded:** Blinsky's distress is real; children will miss their gifts
- **Ominous:** Something on that mountain is watching Vallaki

## Boxed Text

### Discovery

> *Blinsky's Toys is usually a cheerful place—if your definition of "cheerful" includes wind-up skeletons and dolls that weep red tears. Today, however, the shop's macabre whimsy is overshadowed by genuine distress.*
>
> *Gadof Blinsky sits amid scattered tools and empty shelves, his ridiculous hat askew, his eyes red-rimmed. "Is no good," he mumbles when he sees you. "All gone. The toys, the decorations, the joy—all taken. And Blinsky's name will be mud when the Baron learns his festival pieces are missing."*
>
> *He gestures helplessly at the ransacked workshop. "But who? Who would do such thing? And why toys? What monster steals toys?"*

### Following the Trail

> *The pawprints lead you through Vallaki's back alleys, past slumbering houses and shuttered shops, until you reach the northwest wall. There, scuff marks on the stone show where something—or someone—climbed over.*
>
> *Beyond the wall, the prints continue into the snow, two sets now clearly visible: one humanoid, one canine. They head unerringly toward the crooked silhouette on the horizon—Mt. Crumpit, wreathed in Mist, waiting.*
