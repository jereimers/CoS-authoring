## Traits

**Evasion.** If the nimblewright is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the save and only half damage if it fails, provided it doesn't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.


## Actions

**Hooves.** m +6, reach 5 ft. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) Bludgeoning damage. If the nimblewright moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 4 (**1d8**) Bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.


## Bonus Actions

**Nimble Movement.** The nimblewright takes the Disengage action.
