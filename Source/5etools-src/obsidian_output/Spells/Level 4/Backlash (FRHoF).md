# Backlash

*4th-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction (which you take in response to taking damage)  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You ward yourself against destructive energy, reducing the damage taken by `4d6` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

If the triggering damage was from a creature within range, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes **4d6** Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage reduction and Force damage from this spell both increase by `4d6` for every spell slot level above 4.
