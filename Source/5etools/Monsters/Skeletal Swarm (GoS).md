## Traits

**Deafening Clatter.** Creatures are [[deafened]] while in the swarm's space.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Small humanoid. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Slash.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. @h11 (**2d8 + 2**) slashing damage, or 6 (**1d8 + 2**) slashing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
