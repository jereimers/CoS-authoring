## Traits

**Brittle Spine.** For each Brittle Spine a creature has, the creature takes 3 (**1d6**) poison damage at the start of each of their turns, and when Morax activates Burrow or Deep Burrow. Spines can only be removed by a Regeneration spell or similar, or by killing Morax.

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede Morax's darkvision.

**Magic Resistance.** Morax has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spined Hide.** Whenever Morax is hit with a melee attack, the attacker takes 7 (**2d6**) piercing damage and gains 1 Brittle Spine.

**Unbreakable Bond.** If Morax is reduced to 0 hit points while Brother Adramalech still lives, Morax regenerates 50 hit points at the start of his next turn. This regeneration is interrupted if Brother Adramalech is reduced to 0 hit points before the start of Morax's turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Morax makes four attacks using his Claw, Spine Fling, or a combination of the two.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d6 + 7**) slashing damage, and the target gains 1 Brittle Spine.

**Spine Fling.** Ranged Weapon Attack +13 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. @h12 (**1d12 + 6**) piercing damage, and the target gains 1 Brittle Spine.

**Deep Burrow.** Morax immediately deals Brittle Spine ongoing damage to all creatures that have at least one Brittle Spine that he can see.

**Bone Spikes {@recharge}.** Morax shoves an arm into the ground, rapidly growing bones that erupt at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Each creature in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (**8d6**) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save gain 2 Brittle Spines, while creatures that succeed only gain 1 Brittle Spine.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Claw.** Morax makes a Claw attack.

**Bone Splinters (Costs 2 Actions).** Morax gestures at a creature he can see that has at least 1 Brittle Spine. That creature must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or the number of Brittle Spines it has doubles.

**Burrow (Costs 2 Actions).** Morax bristles the spines within a creature that he can see. The target immediately takes Brittle Spine ongoing damage.
