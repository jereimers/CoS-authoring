# Father Donavich Profile

## Portrait


## Roleplaying Information

### Resonance
Donavich should inspire sympathy for his sorrow and fears, pity for his separation from the Morninglord, endearment for his kindness and hospitality, and discomfort for his zealous condemnation of Doru’s undead nature.

### Emotions
In his current state, Donavich most often feels grief, guilt, exhaustion, compassion, and obsession. If reconciled with [[Doru]], he most often feels hope, relief, gratitude, confusion, fear, and shame.

### Motivations
Father Donavich wants to free his son from [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s clutches—at any cost.

### Inspirations
When playing Father Donavich, channel Eddard Stark (Game of Thrones), Walter White (Breaking Bad), and Boromir (The Lord of the Rings).

### Vocal Notes


### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Father Donavich is a grieving, yet zealous father. To those he trusts, Donavich is a broken man adrift in the world, lost and confused without guidance or purpose.

### Morale
In a fight, Father Donavich would ordinarily fight to defend his people and church. In his current state, however, he would immediately surrender, too wracked with guilt to even defend his own life.

### Relationships
Father Donavich is Doru’s father and the priest of the Barovian church.
