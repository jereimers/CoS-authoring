# Street Justice

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Headlock

Your allies have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against a creature [[Grappled|XPHB]] by you.

## Sturdy Knot

When you use [[Chain|XPHB]], [[Manacles|XPHB]], or [[Rope|XPHB]] to bind a creature, add your [[Proficiency|XPHB]] to the DC to escape or burst the [[Chain|XPHB]], [[Manacles|XPHB]], or [[Rope|XPHB]].

## Tough Talk

A creature's [[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB]] attitude doesn't impose [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on your Charisma ([[Intimidation|XPHB]]) checks to influence that creature.
