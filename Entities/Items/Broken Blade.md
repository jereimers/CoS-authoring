A player seeking **justice** begins the campaign with the *broken blade*, the shattered tip of an elven longsword. The blade is engraved with the sigil of a lion rampant, which seems to roar when the light of dusk touches it.

Unbeknownst to the player, the blade once belonged to Erevan, a dusk elf prince. Erevan, a master bladesinger, practiced the style of the lion, which he also used as his personal sigil. However, Erevan refused to pay tribute to King Barov von Zarovich, a powerful warlord and the father of Strahd von Zarovich. 

[[Rahadin]], a dusk elf who had spurned Erevan's rule, helped King Barov conquer the dusk elf kingdom. [[Rahadin]] then broke Erevan's blade and personally executed Erevan and his family as punishment for his defiance. When it senses the presence of Death House, the blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the *broken blade* should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that their ancestors were refugees, driven forth from their ancestral lands and persecuted, and that the blade will one day deliver justice to the traitor who destroyed them.

***Developments.*** If the player shows the *broken blade* to Kasimir Velikov in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]], he mournfully recalls its history and asks the player how they came to possess it. If the player informs Kasimir of how they came to inherit it, Kasimir greets them as family, wondering aloud if more of the dusk elves may have escaped Strahd's slaughter outside of Barovia.

If the *broken blade* is ever in close proximity to [[Rahadin]], Strahd's chamberlain, it emits a high-pitched hum and trembles violently, spinning like a compass needle in his direction just as it did upon sensing Death House. If the player shows the *broken blade* to [[Rahadin]], he at first claims to have no memory of it, noting dispassionately the thousands that he has slaughtered. However, in combat, [[Rahadin]] eventually comes to remember the blade's origins, dismissing it as "the shattered toy of a weak and worthless man."
