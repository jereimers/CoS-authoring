## Traits

**Divinely Blessed.** Alyxian can't be [[surprised]] and can't be changed into another form against his will.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage, or 8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (**2d8**) radiant damage.

**Force Wave (1/Day).** Alyxian strikes the ground, creating a burst of energy that ripples outward. Each creature he chooses within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on himself must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 35 (**10d6**) force damage and be knocked [[prone]]. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].



## Reactions

**Parry.** Alyxian adds 3 to his AC against one attack roll that would hit him. To do so, Alyxian must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.


## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Arch Heart's Strike.** Alyxian makes one Spear attack, and all damage from this attack is radiant.

**Change Bringer's Dance.** Alyxian moves up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Moon Weaver's Veil (Costs 2 Actions).** Alyxian becomes [[invisible]] until the end of his next turn. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying becomes [[invisible]] with him.
