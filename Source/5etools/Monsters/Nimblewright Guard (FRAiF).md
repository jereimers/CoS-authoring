## Traits

**Evasion.** If the nimblewright is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the save and only half damage if it fails, provided it doesn't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nimblewright makes three attacks, using Scimitar or Clockwork Crossbow in any combination.

**Scimitar.** m +6, reach 5 ft. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) Slashing damage.

**Clockwork Crossbow.** r +6, range 80/320 ft. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) Piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** @actTrigger The nimblewright is hit by a melee attack roll while holding a weapon. @actResponse The nimblewright adds 2 to its AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss.
