# Rod of Alertness

*Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This rod has the following properties.

## Alertness

While holding the rod, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]]) checks and on [[Initiative|XPHB]] rolls. Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

- [[Detect Evil and Good|XPHB]]
- [[Detect Magic|XPHB]]
- [[Detect Poison and Disease|XPHB]]
- [[See Invisibility|XPHB]]

## Protective Aura

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 60-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 60 feet. While in that [[Bright Light|XPHB]], you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to [[Armor Class|XPHB]] and saving throws and can sense the location of any [[Invisible|XPHB]] creature that is also in the [[Bright Light|XPHB]].

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
