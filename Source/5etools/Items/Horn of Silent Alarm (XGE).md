# Horn of Silent Alarm

*Wondrous Item, Common*

This horn has 4 charges. When you use an action to blow it, one creature of your choice can hear the horn's blare, provided the creature is within 600 feet of the horn and not [[deafened]]. No other creature hears sound coming from the horn. The horn regains `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn.
