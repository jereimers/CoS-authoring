## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) poison damage.

**Hand Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [[unconscious]] while [[poisoned]] in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.



## Reactions

**Parry.** The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
