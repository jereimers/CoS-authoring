# Dissonant Whispers

*1st-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

One creature of your choice that you can see within range hears a discordant melody in its mind. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes **3d6** Psychic damage and must immediately use its [[Reaction|XPHB]], if available, to move as far away from you as it can, using the safest route. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
