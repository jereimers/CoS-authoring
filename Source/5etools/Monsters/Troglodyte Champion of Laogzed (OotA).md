## Traits

**Chameleon Skin.** The troglodyte has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide.

**Stench.** Any creature other than a troglodyte that starts its turn within 5 feet of the troglodyte must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troglodytes for 1 hour.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the troglodyte has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The troglodyte makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with either its claws or its greatclub.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Greatclub.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.

**Acid Spray {@recharge}.** The troglodyte spits acid in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
