# Joho's Charm

*Charm*

While you have Joho in your possession, it grants you the benefit of a [[helm of comprehending languages]]. This benefit lasts for 7 days while the doll is in your possession, after which the charm vanishes from you.

The doll is a Tiny construct. Destroying the doll causes the child's soul within it to become trapped in [[the Soulmonger|ToA]].
