# Psionic Field

Resonances from the Underdark touch those who venture too deep underground. Each creature in a psionic field must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour.

A creature that starts and finishes a Long Rest in a psionic field experiences disturbing dreams and vivid hallucinations. The creature has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition for `1d10` minutes after the Long Rest, with the source of its fear being the first creature it saw on finishing the Long Rest.
