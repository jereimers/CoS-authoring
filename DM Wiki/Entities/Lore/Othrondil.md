# What It Was

Othrondil, known as the Forest of Twilight, was the ancient homeland of the [[Dusk Elves]] before their subjugation by [[King Barov von Zarovich II]].

# What the Party Knows

From [[Kasimir's Tale]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

- Othrondil was a forested kingdom where the dusk elves dwelled in freedom approximately 500 years ago
- The dusk elves were ruled by a Council of Princes, led by [[Erevan Löwenhart]]
- The forest was home to tree-borne spires carved of dark wood, where the dusk elves lived in harmony with nature
- When [[King Barov von Zarovich II|King Barov]] demanded their fealty and tribute to expand Old Zarovia's borders, [[Erevan Löwenhart|Erevan]] refused
- This act of defiance ignited a war that ended with Barov's conquest and the destruction of dusk elf civilization
- [[Rahadin]], a dusk elf and cousin to [[Kasimir Velikov]], betrayed his people and fought for King Barov during the conquest
- After their subjugation, the surviving dusk elves were eventually led to sanctuary in what would become [[Barovia]] by the [[Vistani]]
- Othrondil itself is lost to history—whether it still exists outside of Barovia's borders is unknown

# The Legacy

[[Kasimir Velikov]]'s hovel contains portraits and artistic depictions of Othrondil's former glory: proud and wise-looking elves, tree-borne spires carved of dark wood, and the lush forest beneath a noonday sun. These images are all that remain of a lost civilization.
