# Who they are

Ireena is the adopted daughter of [[Kolyan Indirovich]] and adopted brother of [[Ismark Kolyanovich]], having lived with them since she was a child—as long as she can remember. She is a fierce, capable, and adroit Barovian woman.

# What the party knows

- Ireena was found when she was a young girl, wandering by the edge of the Svalich Woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. Ireena doesn't remember anything of her past before then, but is grateful to her parents for taking her in and loving her dearly.
- For reasons unclear, Ireena has become the especial target of [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], having been visited (and bitten) by him at least once while dwelling with her brother in the [[Village of Barovia]].

%%CLAUDE: update this page with details that the party has learned about Ireena as of [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found]]%%

## Portrait
![[ireena-kolyana.png]]

### Signature Lines


## Character Information

### Persona
To the world, Ireena is a compassionate, curious, yet stubborn young noblewoman. To those she trusts, Ireena is an anxious, yet determined young woman who dreams of freedom and adventure. Deep down, Ireena wonders whether giving herself up to Strahd would be the best way to protect those she loves.

### Morale
In a fight, Ireena will always turn to words before a sword. If necessary to defend herself, though, she'll draw her rapier—reluctantly, if protecting herself, and proudly, if protecting another.

### Relationships
Ireena is the (knowing) adopted sister of Ismark Kolyanovich, the (unknowing) sister of Izek Strazni, and the (unknowing) reincarnation of Tatyana Federovna.
