## Traits

**Fiery End.** If the magen dies, its body disintegrates in a harmless burst of fire and smoke, leaving behind anything it was wearing or carrying.

**Magic Resistance.** The magen has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unusual Nature.** The magen doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The magen makes two Shocking Touch attacks.

**Shocking Touch.** Melee Spell Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target (the magen has advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal). @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) lightning damage.

**Static Discharge {@recharge 5}.** The magen discharges a lightning bolt in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw (with disadvantage if the creature is wearing armor made of metal), taking 22 (**4d10**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
