# Commune

*5th-level divination (ritual)*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 minute  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S, M (incense)  
**Duration:** 1 minute

---

You contact a deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that can be answered with yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], there is a cumulative 25% chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer.
