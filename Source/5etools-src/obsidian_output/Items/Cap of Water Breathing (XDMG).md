# Cap of Water Breathing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

While wearing this cap underwater, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to create a bubble of air around your head. This bubble allows you to breathe normally underwater. This bubble stays with you until the cap is removed or you are no longer underwater.
