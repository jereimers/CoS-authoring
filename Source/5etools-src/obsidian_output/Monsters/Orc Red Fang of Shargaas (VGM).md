## Traits

**Cunning Action.** On each of its turns, the orc can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

**Hand of Shargaas.** The orc deals 2 extra dice of damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack (included in its attacks).

**Shargaas's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the orc's darkvision.

**Slayer.** In the first round of a combat, the orc has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn yet. If the orc hits a creature that round who was [[surprised]], the hit is automatically a critical hit.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The orc makes two scimitar or dart attacks.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d4 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Veil of Shargaas (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The orc casts [[darkness]] without any components. Wisdom is its spellcasting ability.
