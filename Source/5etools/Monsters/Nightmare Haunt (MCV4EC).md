## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The nightmare haunt has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Somnophage.** At the start of its turn, the nightmare haunt gains a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times the number of [[unconscious]] creatures within 30 feet of itself.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The nightmare haunt makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) psychic damage.

**Tendrils of Slumber {@recharge 5}.** The nightmare haunt creates spectral tendrils that cover the ground in a 20-foot square that it can see within 30 feet of itself for 1 minute or until it uses this action again. When a creature other than the nightmare haunt enters the affected area for the first time or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 11 (**2d10**) necrotic damage and have the [[restrained]] condition. The affected ground is also considered difficult terrain for creatures other than the nightmare haunt for the duration of its effect.

A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already [[restrained]] by the tendrils must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, it has the [[unconscious]] condition and instead of the [[restrained]] condition caused by the tendrils. On a successful save, the effect ends on the creature. An [[unconscious]] creature remains asleep until it is no longer in the area with tendrils, takes any damage, or is targeted by a [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.


## Bonus Actions

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the nightmare haunt takes the Hide action.
