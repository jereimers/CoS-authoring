# Interception

When a creature you can see hits another creature within 5 feet of you with an attack roll, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to reduce the damage dealt to the target by `1d10` plus your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]. You must be holding a [[Shield|XPHB]] or a Simple or Martial weapon to use this [[Reaction|XPHB]].
