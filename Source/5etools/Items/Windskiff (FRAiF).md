# Windskiff

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This small piece of jewelry has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While you are holding it, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to expend 1 charge, which causes the jewelry to transform into a sail-powered personal vehicle. The vehicle is roughly the size and shape of a household door with a 10-foot-tall sail extending from one side. After 1 hour or until you use the item's command word (no action required), the transformation ends and the Windskiff reverts to its jewelry form.

In vehicle form, a Windskiff is a Medium object with the following statistics: AC 12, HP 30, and [[Speed|XPHB]] 40 ft. The Windskiff hovers a few inches above whatever surface it's on and can glide; it moves 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends in the air. A Windskiff and its riders take no damage from falling.
