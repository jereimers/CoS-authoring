## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The living spell has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Unfettered.** The living spell can move through any barrier, even a wall of magical force.

**Unusual Nature.** The living spell doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Force Blade.** Melee Spell Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h26 (**4d12**) force damage, unless the living spell rolled an 18 or higher on the `d20` for the attack, in which case the attack is a critical hit that deals 78 (**12d12**) force damage instead.



## Reactions

**Preemptive Strike.** The living spell makes a melee attack against a creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the living spell.
