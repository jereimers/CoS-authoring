# Goliath

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Little Giant

You have proficiency in the [[Athletics]] skill, and you count as one size larger when determining your carrying weight and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

## Mountain Born

You have resistance to cold damage. You also naturally acclimate to high altitudes, even if you've never been to one. This includes elevations above 20,000 feet.

## Stone's Endurance

You can supernaturally draw on unyielding stone to shrug off harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a `d12`. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
