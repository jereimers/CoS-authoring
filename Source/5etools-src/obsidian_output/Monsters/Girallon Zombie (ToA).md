## Traits

**Aggressive.** As a bonus action, the zombie can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The zombie makes five attacks: one with its bite and four with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) slashing damage.
