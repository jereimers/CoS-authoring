## Traits

**Unusual Nature.** The parasite doesn't require air or sleep.


## Actions

**Cling.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h12 (**3d6 + 2**) necrotic damage, and the parasite attaches to the target. While attached, the parasite can't make Cling attacks. The parasite can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. As an action, a creature within reach of the parasite can try to detach it, doing so with a successful DC 14 Strength check.

**Consume Life.** The parasite deals 12 (**3d6 + 2**) necrotic damage to one creature it is physically attached to, provided that creature isn't a Construct or an Undead. The parasite regains hit points equal to the damage taken.


## Bonus Actions

**Suggestion (Psionics; 1/Day).** The parasite casts the [[suggestion]] spell, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13).
