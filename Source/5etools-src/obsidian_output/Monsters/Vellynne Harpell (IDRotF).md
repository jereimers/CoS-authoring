## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Vellynne wears [[bracers of defense]] and carries a [[wand of magic missiles]] (see "Actions" below).


## Actions

**Vampiric Touch (3rd-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).** Melee Spell Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage, and Vellynne regains hit points equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. If Vellynne casts this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the necrotic damage increases by **1d6** for each slot level above 3rd.

**Chill Touch (Cantrip).** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage, and the target can't regain hit points until the start of Vellynne's next turn.

**Wand of Magic Missiles.** While holding this wand, Vellynne can expend 1 or more of its 7 charges to cast the [[magic missile]] spell from it. She can expend 1 charge to cast the 1st-level version of the spell. She can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge she expends. The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If the wand's last charge is expended, roll a `d20`; on a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
