# Censer of Controlling Air Elementals

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

While gently swinging this censer, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to summon an [[Air Elemental|XMM]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the censer as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[Initiative|XPHB]] count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]]. The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
