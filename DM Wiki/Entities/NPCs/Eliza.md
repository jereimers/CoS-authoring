# Who they are

Eliza is a [[Vistani]] traveler who appeared at the [[Tser Pool Encampment]] alongside [[Arturi Radanavich]]. She presents herself as friendly and inviting, though the party strongly suspects she is the "shadow" servant of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] that [[Madam Eva]] warned them about.

# What the party knows

- Eliza is a [[Vistani]] woman who arrived at the Tser Pool camp with [[Arturi Radanavich]]
- She has a friendly, inviting demeanor
- She participated in the Game of Stories, telling [[Eliza's Tale]]—the half-true legend of Lugdana, the Morninglord's champion, who fell banishing the demon Chernovog at Yester Hill
- [[Madam Eva]] warned the party about a "shadow" approaching her tent, "a lone servant of Darkness who seeks knowledge of your future"—the party strongly suspects this refers to Eliza
- The morning after the Game of Stories, she appeared somewhat flustered and haggard, straining to maintain a calm demeanor under [[Arden Nalero|Arden]]'s suspicious gaze
- She offered [[Fig Fleetfoot|Fig]] a cup of lavender chamomile tea
