# K2. Center Court Gate

Two gates, one north of the keep and one to the south, prevent easy access to what lies beyond them.

A massive wall juts out to connect the outer walls of the castle with the keep. A twenty-foot-wide, twenty-foot-tall archway offers passage through the connecting wall but is blocked by a rusting iron portcullis.

The portcullis is unlocked and can be lifted with a successful DC 15 Strength check. It can also be opened with a command word that only Strahd and Cyrus Belview (area K62) know. Unless the portcullis is wedged or propped open, it falls back into place once it is let go.
