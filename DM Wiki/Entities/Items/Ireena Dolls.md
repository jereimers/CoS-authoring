# What They Are

A collection of handcrafted dolls commissioned by [[Izek Strazni]] from the toymaker [[Gadof Blinsky]]. Each doll is meticulously crafted to resemble a young woman with auburn hair and striking features.

# What the Party Knows

From the [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Raiding the Vallakovich Library (Politely)|library death records]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

## The Commission Records

- [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]]'s ledgers show regular payments to Gadof Blinsky, the eccentric toymaker
- The payments are for custom dolls commissioned by Izek Strazni
- Each doll is described as depicting "a young woman with auburn hair"
- The commissions have been ongoing for some time, suggesting Izek has accumulated a collection

## Description

Based on the ledger entries:
- Handcrafted by Gadof Blinsky, known for his peculiar but skillful work
- Each doll depicts the same subject: a young woman
- Auburn hair is the distinctive feature mentioned in the records
- The dolls appear to be important enough to Izek that he regularly pays for new ones
