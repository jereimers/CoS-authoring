# Minotaur

**Size:** Medium  
**Speed:** 30  
**Ability Score Increase:** STR +2, CON +1

*These traits are also suitable for minotaurs in other D&D worlds where these people have avoided the demonic influence of Baphomet.*

## Age

Minotaurs enter adulthood at around the age of 17 and can live up to 150 years.

## Alignment

Most minotaurs who join the Boros Legion lean toward lawful alignments, while those associated with the Cult of Rakdos or the Gruul Clans tend toward chaotic alignments.

## Size

Minotaurs average over 6 feet in height, and they have stocky builds. Your size is Medium.

## Horns

Your horns are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to **1d6** + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

## Goring Rush

Immediately after you use the [[Dash]] action on your turn and move at least 20 feet, you can make one melee attack with your horns as a bonus action.

## Hammering Horns

Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove that target with your horns. The target must be no more than one size larger than you and within 5 feet of you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you.

## Imposing Presence

You have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: [[Intimidation]] or [[Persuasion]].

## Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur.
