## Traits

**Evasion.** If the thief is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the thief instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails, provided the thief isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The thief makes three Shortsword or Shortbow attacks.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) poison damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) poison damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Cunning Action.** The thief takes the [[Dash]], [[Disengage]], or [[Hide]] action.


## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** The thief halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The thief must be able to see the attacker.
