## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe air and water.

**Stygian Wasting.** Creatures afflicted with this disease are incapable of regaining hit points in any way until the disease is cured. Additionally, as their flesh starts to rot, a creature with this disease takes 36 (**8d8**) necrotic damage after each long rest they finish.

**Styx Dweller.** The dragon is immune to all negative effects from the River Styx.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks using its Bite, Tail, or a combination of the two. It can replace one of the attacks with Constrict.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d10 + 8**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) poison damage, and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target contracts Stygian Wasting.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d6 + 8**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 22). The dragon can't make a Tail attack while a creature is [[grappled]] in this way.

**Constrict.** The dragon tightens its grip on a creature [[grappled]] by its tail. The creature takes 27 (**3d12 + 8**) bludgeoning damage, has the [[restrained]] condition until the start of the dragon's next turn, and must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target contracts Stygian Wasting.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[frightened]] condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Stygian Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales poisonous Styx water in a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (**12d8**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save contract Stygian Wasting.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a Tail attack. If a creature is already [[grappled]], the dragon may use Constrict instead.

**Death Throw (Costs 3 Actions).** If the dragon has successfully [[restrained]] a creature with the Constrict ability, it may throw them up to 100 feet away. When it lands, the creature takes 21 (**6d6**) bludgeoning damage and must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[unconscious]] condition for 10 minutes.
