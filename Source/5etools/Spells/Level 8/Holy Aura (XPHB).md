*8th-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** {'type': 'emanation', 'distance': {'type': 'feet', 'amount': 30}}  
**Components:** V, S, M (a reliquary worth 1,000+ GP)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

For the duration, you emit an aura in a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. While in the aura, creatures of your choice have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on all saving throws, and other creatures have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against them. In addition, when a Fiend or an Undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack roll, the attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition until the end of its next turn.
