# Rod of the Vonindod

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

The [[fire giant]] Duke Zalto hired a wizard to craft several of these adamantine rods. Each measures 4 feet long, weighs 100 pounds, and is sized to fit comfortably in a [[fire giant|]] hand. The rod has two prongs at one end and a molded handle grip on the opposite end.

The rod has 10 charges and regains `1d6 + 4` of its expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can grasp it by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the [[locate object]] spell from it. When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the Vonindod construct, its range increases to 10 miles.
