# K45. Hall of Heroes

Dark alcoves line the walls of this long hall. The ceiling has fallen here, leaving rubble strewn across the floor. Overhead, the beams of Ravenloft's roof are exposed. Lightning from the dark clouds above sporadically illuminates the hall, lighting the faces of life-sized human statues in the alcoves. Each visage is frozen in terror.

The ten statues that line this corridor depict ancient heroes. In actuality, the faces of the statues are stoic and expressionless, but whenever the lightning flashes, their expressions change to utter horror until the hall goes dark again.

The statues are imbued with the spirits of Strahd's ancestors, all of which grieve over the termination of their bloodline. Each spirit will answer one question if addressed directly. The spirits' answers are always short and vague, and there is a 20 percent chance that a spirit's answer is wrong.

The stairs at the west end of the hall descend 40 feet to area K33. An open archway to the east reveals a tower landing beyond (part of area K20).
