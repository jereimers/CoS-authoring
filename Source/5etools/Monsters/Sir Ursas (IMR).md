## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Sir Ursas wears a [[ring of mind shielding]] and [[plate armor of fire resistance]].

**Brave.** Sir Ursas has advantage on saving throws against being [[frightened]].

**Brute.** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when Sir Ursas hits with it (included in his attack).


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Sir Ursas makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) piercing damage, or 13 (**2d8 + 4**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

**Shield Bash.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].



## Reactions

**Parry.** Sir Ursas adds 3 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, he must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
