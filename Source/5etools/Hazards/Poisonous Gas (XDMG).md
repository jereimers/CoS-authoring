# Poisonous Gas

Poisonous gas is usually encountered in an enclosed space, such as a sewer or sealed tomb. The gas fills as much space as it can, up to a maximum of ten 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. The transparent gas carries a foul odor. The gas is continuously or periodically replenished by some natural or magical source, though a strong wind disperses the gas for 1 minute.

Any creature that enters poisonous gas for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (**1d10**) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures in the gas also have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on [[Death Saving Throw|XPHB]].

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Poison damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Poison Damage | Save DC |
|---|---|---|
| 5–10 | 11 (**2d10**) | 14 |
| 11–16 | 22 (**4d10**) | 16 |
| 17–20 | 55 (**10d10**) | 18 |
