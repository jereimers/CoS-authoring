## Traits

**Aura of Menace.** As long as the archon doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition, each creature of the archon's choice that starts its turn within 20 feet of the archon must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[frightened]] condition until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to all archons' Aura of Menace for 24 hours.

**Eternal Vigil.** The archon can't be surprised. Moreover, it knows when any creature uses a portal it is assigned to guard.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The archon makes two Claw attacks and one Tracker's Bite attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 18). The archon can have only one creature [[grappled]] in this way at a time.

**Tracker's Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, for the next 24 hours, the archon knows the distance and direction to the target while they are both on the same plane of existence.

**Teleport.** The archon teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 120 feet of itself.
