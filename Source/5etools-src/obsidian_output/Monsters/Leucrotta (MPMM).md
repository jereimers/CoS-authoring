## Traits

**Mimicry.** The leucrotta can mimic Beast sounds and Humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations only with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check.

**Stench.** Any creature other than a leucrotta or gnoll that starts its turn within 5 feet of the leucrotta must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Stench of all leucrottas for 1 hour.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The leucrotta makes one Bite attack and one Hooves attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage. If the leucrotta scores a critical hit, it rolls the damage dice three times, instead of twice.

**Hooves.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Kicking Retreat.** Immediately after the leucrotta makes a Hooves attack, it takes the [[Disengage]] action.
