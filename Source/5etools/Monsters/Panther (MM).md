## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The panther has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Pounce.** If the panther moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is [[prone]], the panther can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) slashing damage.
