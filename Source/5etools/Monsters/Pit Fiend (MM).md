## Traits

**Fear Aura.** Any creature hostile to the pit fiend that starts its turn within 20 feet of the pit fiend must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, unless the pit fiend is [[incapacitated]]. On a failed save, the creature is [[frightened]] until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the pit fiend's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

**Magic Resistance.** The pit fiend has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The pit fiend's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The pit fiend makes four attacks: one with its bite, one with its claw, one with its mace, and one with its tail.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h22 (**4d6 + 8**) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]]. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target can't regain hit points, and it takes 21 (**6d6**) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The [[poisoned]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**2d8 + 8**) slashing damage.

**Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d6 + 8**) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (**6d6**) fire damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h24 (**3d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage.
