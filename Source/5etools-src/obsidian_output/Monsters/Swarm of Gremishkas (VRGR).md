## Traits

**Limited Spell Immunity.** The swarm automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells of 3rd level or lower, and the attack rolls of such spells always miss it.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny gremishka. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. @h12 (**3d6 + 2**) piercing damage, or 5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, plus 7 (**2d6**) force damage.



## Reactions

**Spell Redirection.** In response to a spell attack roll missing the swarm, the swarm causes that spell to hit another creature of its choice within 30 feet of it that it can see.
