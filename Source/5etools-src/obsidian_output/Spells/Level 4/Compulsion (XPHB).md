# Compulsion

*4th-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition until the spell ends.

For the duration, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each [[Charmed|XPHB]] target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn, taking the safest route. After moving in this way, a target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.
