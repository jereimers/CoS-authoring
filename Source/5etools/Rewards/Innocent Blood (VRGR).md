# Innocent Blood

*Curse*

The tragic situation came to pass where a character killed an undeserving person, who laid a vengeful curse in punishment.

### Pronouncement

The dying victim spits final words: "You shall spill innocent blood until laid low by the moon's bite!"

### Burden

The character is cursed with [[loup garou|VRGR]] lycanthropy (see [[chapter 5|VRGR]]).

### Resolution

This curse can't be broken until the character is reduced to 0 hit points by a silvered weapon. If the character survives, the curse can be broken as described in the "[[Loup Garou Lycanthropy|VRGR]]" section of [[chapter 5|VRGR]]. Treat the character as a [[werewolf]] whose loup garou progenitor has been killed.
