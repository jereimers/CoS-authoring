## Traits

**Magic Sense.** The hunter knows the location of every spellcaster, active spell, and magic item within 120 feet of itself.

**Spider Climb (Hunter Form Only).** The hunter can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack (Hunter Form Only).** The hunter makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw (Hunter Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h22 (**4d8 + 4**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the hunter can't make a Tail attack against another target.

**Mage Tracker (Sentry Form Only).** The hunter emits a pulse of energy that helps it better locate its magical quarry. Each creature within 120 feet of the hunter that has the ability to cast spells must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be mystically marked by the hunter for 1 hour.

While marked, a creature can't become hidden from the hunter and gains no benefit from the [[invisible]] condition against the hunter. Additionally, while a marked creature is on the same plane of existence as the hunter, the hunter always knows the distance and direction to the creature.


## Bonus Actions

**Shift Form.** The hunter folds into its drone-like sentry form or unfolds into its hunter form. Its game statistics are the same in each form.


## Reactions

**Consume and Destroy.** When the hunter takes damage from a spell, it takes only half the triggering damage (rounded down). If the creature that cast the spell is within 60 feet of the hunter, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take the other half of the damage.
