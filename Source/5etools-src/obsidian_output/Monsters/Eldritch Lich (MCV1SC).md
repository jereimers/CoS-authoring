## Traits

**Far Realm Parasite.** Inside the lich's torso dwells a wormlike parasite that contains the lich's soul. When the lich dies, it implodes into the parasite, which then vanishes into the Far Realm. In `2d4` days, the parasite causes the lich to reappear within `1d4` miles of where it died. If the lich died inside a magic circle cast to contain Undead, the lich instead reappears as an [[otyugh]] with all the lich's memories.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Unusual Nature.** The lich doesn't need air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The lich makes one Parasitic Tentacle attack or uses Spellcasting. The lich also uses Psychic Whisper twice.

**Parasitic Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h25 (**6d6 + 4**) piercing damage plus 25 (**6d6 + 4**) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]]. The [[poisoned]] target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The third time the target fails the save, the target dies and dissolves into a [[gibbering mouther]] that obeys the lich and uses the target's initiative.

**Psychic Whisper.** The lich targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 25 (**6d6 + 4**) psychic damage and be [[stunned]] until the end of the lich's next turn as incomprehensible whispers fill the target's mind.



## Reactions

**Far Realm Step.** Immediately after taking damage, the lich, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
