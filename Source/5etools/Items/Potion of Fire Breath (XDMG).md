# Potion of Fire Breath

*Item, Uncommon*

After drinking this potion, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of yourself. The target makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking **4d6** Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed.

This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.
