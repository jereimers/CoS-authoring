## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three Rend attacks.

**Rend.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) force damage.

**Time Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a wave of shimmering light in a 30-foot cone. Nonmagical objects and vegetation in that area that aren't being worn or carried crumble to dust. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 (**7d8**) force damage and is magically weakened as it is desynchronized from the time stream. While the creature is in this state, attack rolls against it have advantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A weakened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself after it succeeds on two of these saves.
