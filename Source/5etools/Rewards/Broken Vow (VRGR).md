# Broken Vow

*Curse*

A character breaks a solemn vow. The consequences stem from the powers that observed the oath's swearing.

### Pronouncement

Whatever vow the character made, it came with an implied warning that guilt and restlessness would beset anyone who broke the oath.

### Burden

The character is plagued by restless sleep and recurring nightmares featuring those the character swore to protect. The character gains 3 levels of [[exhaustion]] that can't be removed until the curse ends.

### Resolution

The curse lasts until the character upholds the broken oath. That might require the character to wait until the circumstances arise again or, more questionably, to engineer the circumstances.
