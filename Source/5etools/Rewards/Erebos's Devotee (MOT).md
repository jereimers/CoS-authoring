# Erebos's Devotee

*Piety Trait*

*Piety 3+ Erebos trait*

As a devotee of Erebos, you have proven yourself an executor of the Underworld's grim laws. You can call on Erebos's favor to cast [[bane]] with this trait, requiring no material components, a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
