# Holy Water

*Item, None*

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a flask of Holy Water. Target one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or take **2d8** Radiant damage if it is a Fiend or an Undead.
