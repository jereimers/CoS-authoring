# Shove Aside

**Time:** 1 action

With this option, a creature uses the special [[shove]] attack from the [[Player's Handbook|PHB]] to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength ([[Athletics]]) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.
