## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The drow makes three Scimitar or Arcane Eruption attacks. The drow can replace one of the attacks with a use of Spellcasting.

**Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d6 + 5**) slashing damage plus 27 (**6d8**) poison damage.

**Arcane Eruption.** Ranged Spell Attack +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h36 (**8d8**) force damage, and the drow can push the target up to 10 feet away if it is a Large or smaller creature.



## Reactions

**Protective Shield (3/Day).** When the drow or a creature within 10 feet of it is hit by an attack roll, the drow gives the target a +5 bonus to its AC until the start of the drow's next turn, which can cause the triggering attack roll to miss.
