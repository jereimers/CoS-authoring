# Blindness/Deafness

*2nd-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V

One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] or [[Deafened|XPHB]] condition (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.
