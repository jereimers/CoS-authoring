# Hide of the Feral Guardian (Dormant)

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

It is believed that this polished and beautifully detailed leather armor was a gift from Melora, bestowed on a long-forgotten archdruid and champion of the natural world before the terrors of the Calamity.

## Dormant

While wearing the armor in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor grants you a +1 bonus to AC.
- While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, you have a +1 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls, and you retain the benefits of this armor.
- As an action, you can use the armor to cast [[polymorph]] on yourself, transforming into a [[giant owl]] while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
