# Harm

*6th-level necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You unleash virulent magic on a creature you can see within range. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes **14d6** Necrotic damage, and its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage it took. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. This spell can't reduce a target's [[Hit Points|XPHB]] maximum below 1.
