# Sovereign Glue

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[oil of slipperiness]]. When found, a container contains `1d6 + 1` ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [[universal solvent]] or [[oil of etherealness]], or with a [[wish]] spell.
