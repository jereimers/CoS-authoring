# Sword of Answering

*Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this sword. In addition, while you hold the sword, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to make one melee attack with it against any creature in your reach that deals damage to you. You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on the attack roll, and any damage dealt with this special attack ignores any [[Immunity|XPHB]] or [[Resistance|XPHB]] the target has to that damage.
