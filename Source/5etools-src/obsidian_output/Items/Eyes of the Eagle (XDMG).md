# Eyes of the Eagle

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]]) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
