## Traits

**Axiomatic Mind.** The hexton can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Combat Ready.** The hexton has advantage on initiative rolls.

**Disintegration.** If the hexton dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind anything it was carrying.

**Legendary Resistance (4/Day).** If the hexton fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hexton makes one Pincer attack and two Tentacle attacks.

**Pincer.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the hexton can't use this tentacle against other targets. The hexton has six tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.



## Reactions

**Counter Magic.** The hexton attempts to interrupt a creature it can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 4th level or higher, the hexton makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect.

**Lightning Rebuke.** When a creature within 120 feet of the hexton damages it, the hexton magically retaliates with an arc of lightning. The creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (**2d10**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
