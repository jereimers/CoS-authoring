# +2 All-Purpose Tool

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by an artificer)*

This simple screwdriver can transform into a variety of tools; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of artisan's tool of your choice (see the "Equipment" chapter in the [[Player's Handbook|PHB]] for a list of [[artisan's tools|PHB]]). Whatever form the tool takes, you are proficient with it.

While holding this tool, you gain a +2 bonus to the spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your artificer spells.

As an action, you can focus on the tool to channel your creative forces. Choose a cantrip that you don't know from any class list. For 8 hours, you can cast that cantrip, and it counts as an artificer cantrip for you. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
