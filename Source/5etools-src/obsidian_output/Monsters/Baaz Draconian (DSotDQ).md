## Traits

**Controlled Fall.** When the draconian falls and isn't [[incapacitated]], it subtracts up to 100 feet from the fall when calculating the fall's damage.

**Death Throes.** When the draconian is reduced to 0 hit points, its body turns to stone and releases a petrifying gas. Each creature within 5 feet of the draconian must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [[restrained]] as it begins to turn to stone. The [[restrained]] creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends; otherwise the creature is [[petrified]] for 1 minute. After 1 minute, the body of the draconian crumbles to dust.

**Draconic Devotion.** While the draconian can see a Dragon that isn't hostile to it, the draconian has advantage on attack rolls.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The draconian makes two Shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage.
