## Traits

**Amphibious.** The dragon can breathe both air and water.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d10 + 2**) piercing damage plus 2 (**1d4**) necrotic damage.

**Desiccating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (**6d6**) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.
