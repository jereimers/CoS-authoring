# Arrow-Catching Shield

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to [[Armor Class|XPHB]] against ranged attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to become the target of the attack instead.
