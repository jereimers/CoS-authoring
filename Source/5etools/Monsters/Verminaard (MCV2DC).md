## Traits

**Draconic Command.** Whenever a Dragon or a creature with the Draconic Devotion trait within 30 feet of Verminaard makes an attack roll, the creature can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the attack roll.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Verminaard fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Special Equipment.** Verminaard wears [[+2 plate armor]] and wields the mace [[Nightbringer|MCV2DC]], which grants him darkvision as well as immunity to fire damage and to the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions (included above).

**Multiattack.** Verminaard makes two Nightbringer attacks and uses Malediction.

**Nightbringer.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**1d6 + 9**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**4d4**) radiant damage. If the target is a creature, the target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [[blinded]] until the start of Verminaard's next turn.

**Malediction.** Verminaard utters an unholy word, causing profane fire to descend on one creature Verminaard can see within 60 feet of himself.
