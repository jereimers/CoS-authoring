# Staff of Withering

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)*

This staff has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.

The staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal Quarterstaff , and you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra **2d10** Necrotic damage to the target and force it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] for 1 hour on any ability check or saving throw that uses Strength or Constitution.
