## Traits

**Encephalon Progeny.** The gemmule matures into an encephalon cluster if not killed within 30 (`4d12 + 4`) days of its creation.

**Magic Resistance.** The gemmule has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Psychic Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**3d10**) psychic damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Leech.** The gemmule targets one creature within 5 feet of itself and forces the target to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the gemmule enters the target's space and attaches to the target. While the gemmule is attached, the target takes 7 (**3d4**) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, and the gemmule can't use Leech again until it detaches. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. As an action, the target or a creature within 5 feet of the target can detach the gemmule by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check.
