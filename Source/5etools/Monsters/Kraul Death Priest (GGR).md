## Traits

**Feed on Death.** When a creature within 30 feet of the kraul drops to 0 hit points, the kraul or another creature of its choice within 30 feet of it gains 5 (`1d10`) temporary hit points, provided the kraul isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Hive Mind.** The kraul is immune to the [[charmed]] and [[frightened]] conditions while within 30 feet of at least one other kraul.

**Pack Tactics.** The kraul has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kraul's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Spider Climb.** The kraul can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kraul makes one attack with its quarterstaff and casts one of its spells with a casting time of 1 action.

**Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage, or 7 (**1d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage if used with two hands.
