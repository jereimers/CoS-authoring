# Spellfire Spark

You gain the following benefits.

## Magic Absorption

Once per turn, when you take damage from a spell or magical effect, you reduce the total damage taken by `1d4`. You can't use this benefit if you have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.

## Spellfire Flame

You learn the [[Sacred Flame|XPHB]] cantrip. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you select this feat). You can also cast this cantrip as a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
