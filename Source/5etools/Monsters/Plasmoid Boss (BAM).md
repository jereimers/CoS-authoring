## Traits

**Amorphous.** The plasmoid can squeeze through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide, provided it is wearing and carrying nothing. It has advantage on ability checks it makes to initiate or escape a grapple.

**Hold Breath.** The plasmoid can hold its breath for 1 hour.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The plasmoid makes three Pseudopod attacks.

**Pseudopod.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit (with advantage if the plasmoid has one or more allies within 10 feet of itself), reach 10 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.



## Reactions

**Uncanny Dodge.** The plasmoid halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The plasmoid must be able to see the attacker.
