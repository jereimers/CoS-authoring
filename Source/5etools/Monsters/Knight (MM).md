## Traits

**Brave.** The knight has advantage on saving throws against being [[frightened]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The knight makes two melee attacks.

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d10**) piercing damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** For 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `d4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is [[incapacitated]].



## Reactions

**Parry.** The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
