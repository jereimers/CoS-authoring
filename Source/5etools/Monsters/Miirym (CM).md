## Traits

**Bound to Candlekeep.** Miirym can't leave Candlekeep and is immune to any effect that would place her in a location outside it, including an extradimensional space. If she dies, Miirym regains her form and all her hit points after `1d10` days, reappearing in the location where she died or in the nearest unoccupied space.

**Regeneration.** Miirym regains 40 hit points at the start of her turn. If Miirym takes damage from a magic weapon or a spell, this trait doesn't function at the start of Miirym's next turn. Miirym dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Incorporeal Movement.** Miirym can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (**1d10**) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Miirym fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**X-Ray Vision.** Miirym can see through solid matter out to a range of 60 feet. To her, opaque creatures, objects, and obstacles within that distance appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. This vision can penetrate 5 feet of stone, 3 inches of common metal, and up to 10 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block this vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h34 (**9d6 + 3**) force damage.

**Breath Weapon {@recharge 5}.** Miirym uses one of the following breath weapons:

**Cold Breath.** Miirym exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 67 (**15d8**) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Necrotic Breath.** Miirym exhales a bolt of necrotic energy in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 82 (**15d10**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Paralyzing Breath.** Miirym exhales paralyzing gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of Miirym's choice that is within 120 feet of her and aware of her must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Miirym's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Bite.** Miirym makes a bite attack.

**Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** Miirym magically teleports up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.
