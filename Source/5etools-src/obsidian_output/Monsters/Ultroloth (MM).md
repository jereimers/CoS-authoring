## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The ultroloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The ultroloth's weapon attacks are magical.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The ultroloth can use its Hypnotic Gaze and makes three melee attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) slashing damage, or 8 (**1d10 + 3**) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Hypnotic Gaze.** The ultroloth's eyes sparkle with opalescent light as it targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the ultroloth, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be [[charmed]] until the end of the ultroloth's next turn. The [[charmed]] target is [[stunned]]. If the target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the ultroloth's gaze for the next 24 hours.
