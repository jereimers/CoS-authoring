# Gift of the Protectors

A new page appears in your Book of Shadows when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name).

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can erase a name on the page by touching it.
