## Traits

**Enthralling Performance.** If the satyr performs for at least 1 minute, it chooses up to four humanoids within 60 feet of it who watched or listened to the entire performance. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[charmed]]. While [[charmed]] in this way, the target idolizes the satyr and will take part in the satyr's revels. The [[charmed]] condition ends for the creature after 1 hour, if it takes any damage, if the satyr attacks the target, or if the target witnesses the satyr attacking or damaging any of the target's allies.

**Magic Resistance.** The satyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sleepless Reveler.** Magic can't put the satyr to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The satyr makes two ram attacks or two shortbow attacks.

**Ram.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**2d4 + 1**) bludgeoning damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.
