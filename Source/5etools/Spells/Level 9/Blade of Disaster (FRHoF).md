# Blade of Disaster

*9th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

You create a 3-foot-long blade-shaped planar rift that lasts for the duration. The rift appears within range in a space of your choice, and you can immediately make up to two melee spell attacks, each one against a creature or object within 5 feet of the rift. On a hit, the target takes **10d6** Force damage. This attack scores a [[Critical Hit|XPHB]] if the number on the `d20` is 18 or higher.

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] on your later turns, you can move the rift up to 60 feet and repeat the two attacks against a creature or an object within 5 feet of it. You can direct the attacks at the same target or at different ones.

The blade can harmlessly pass through any barrier, including ones created by spells like [[Wall of Force|XPHB]].
