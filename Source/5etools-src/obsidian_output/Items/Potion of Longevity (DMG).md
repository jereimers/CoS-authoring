# Potion of Longevity

*Item, Very Rare*

When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by `1d6 + 6` years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is a 10% cumulative chance that you instead age by `1d6 + 6` years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
