## Traits

**Devil's Sight.** Magical darkness doesn't impede the kocrachon's darkvision.

**Infernal Rot.** A creature afflicted with this disease has the [[poisoned]] condition until the disease ends. While diseased, creatures gain no benefits from a long rest, gaining [[exhaustion]] when necessary. If a creature dies while afflicted with Infernal Rot, its corpse transforms into a newborn kocrachon after 4 (`1d8`) days.

**Magic Resistance.** The kocrachon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Sadism.** The kocrachon gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls for each different creature it damaged on its previous turn.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The kocrachon makes three Claw attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with a Proboscis attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Proboscis.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d12 + 4**) piercing damage plus 14 (**4d6**) poison damage. Creatures damaged by this attack must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer the Infernal Rot disease.
