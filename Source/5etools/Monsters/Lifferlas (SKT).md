## Traits

**False Appearance.** While Lifferlas remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.

**Roleplaying Information.** A druid of the Emerald Enclave awakened the tree Lifferlas with a spell. Goldenfields is his home, its people his friends. Children like to carve their name and initials into his body and hang from his boughs, and he's happy with that.

Ideal: "I exist to protect the people and plants of Goldenfields."

Bond: "Children are wonderful. I would do anything to make them feel happy and safe."

Flaw: "I can't remember people's names and often get them mixed up."


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Lifferlas makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage.
