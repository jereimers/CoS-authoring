## Traits

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny scarab. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

**Skeletonize.** If the swarm starts its turn in the same space as a dead creature that is Large or smaller, the corpse is destroyed, leaving behind only equipment and bones (or exoskeleton).

**Spider Climb.** The swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Ravenous Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. @h14 (**4d6**) piercing damage, or 7 (**2d6**) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. If the target is a creature, scarabs burrow into its body, and the creature takes 3 (**1d6**) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. Any creature can use an action to kill or remove the scarabs with fire or a weapon that deals piercing damage, causing 1 damage of the appropriate type to the target. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the swarm's piercing damage dies.
