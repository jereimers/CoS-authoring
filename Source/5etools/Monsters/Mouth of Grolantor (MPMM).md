## Traits

**Mouth of Chaos.** The giant is immune to the [[confusion]] spell.

On each of its turns, the giant uses all its movement to move toward the nearest creature or whatever else it might perceive as food. Roll a `d10` at the start of each of the giant's turns to determine its action for that turn:

- **1–3::** The giant makes three Fist attacks against one random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant flies into a rage and gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.
- **4–5::** The giant makes one Fist attack against each creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant makes one Fist attack against itself.
- **6–7::** The giant makes one Bite attack against one random creature within reach. If no other creatures are within reach, its eyes glaze over and it is [[stunned]] until the start of its next turn.
- **8–10::** The giant makes one Bite attack and two Fist attacks against one random creature within reach. If no creatures are within reach, the giant flies into a rage and gains advantage on all attack rolls until the end of its next turn.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h15 (**3d6 + 5**) piercing damage, and the giant magically regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

**Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h18 (**3d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.
