While wearing this pendant, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to regain `2d4 + 2` [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

In addition, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws to avoid or end the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition while you wear this pendant.
