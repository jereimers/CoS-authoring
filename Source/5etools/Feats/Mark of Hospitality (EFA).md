# Mark of Hospitality

You gain the following benefits.

## Ever Hospitable

When you make a Charisma ([[Persuasion|XPHB]]) check or an ability check using [[Brewer's Supplies|XPHB]] or [[Cook's Utensils|XPHB]], you can roll `1d4` and add the number rolled to the ability check.

## Innkeeper's Magic

You always have the [[Purify Food and Drink|XPHB]] and [[Unseen Servant|XPHB]] spells prepared. You can cast each spell once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells (choose when you select this feat).

When you reach character level 3, you also always have the [[Calm Emotions|XPHB]] spell prepared and can cast it the same way
