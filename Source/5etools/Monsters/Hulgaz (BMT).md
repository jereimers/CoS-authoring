## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Hulgaz fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Hulgaz has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Hulgaz makes two Claw attacks and one Intoxicating Sting attack.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Intoxicating Sting.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h8 (**1d10 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[charmed]] condition until the start of Hulgaz's next turn.

**Brimstone Vapor {@recharge 5}.** Hulgaz exhales a 30-foot cone of noxious, scorching-hot vapor. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. While [[poisoned]] in this way, a creature takes 31 (**7d8**) fire damage at the start of each of its turns and has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws. A target can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Attack.** Hulgaz makes one Claw attack.

**Charm.** Hulgaz uses Spellcasting to cast [[Charm Person]].

**Curdle Heart (Costs 2 Actions).** Hulgaz sours the good feelings of her [[charmed]] victims. She chooses any number of creatures she can see who are [[charmed]] by her. Each target takes 17 (**5d6**) psychic damage as the [[charmed]] condition applied by Hulgaz ends on it.
