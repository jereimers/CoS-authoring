# Conjure Volley

*5th-level conjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 150 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a Melee or Ranged weapon worth at least 1 CP)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You brandish the weapon used to cast the spell and choose a point within range. Hundreds of similar spectral weapons (or ammunition appropriate to the weapon) fall in a volley and then disappear. Each creature of your choice that you can see in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high [[Cylinder [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes **8d8** Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
