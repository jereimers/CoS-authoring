# Poisoned Tempest

This fiendish trap was built to eliminate intruders who infiltrate a yuan-ti temple. The trap is a room, 60 feet on a side, with 5-foot-wide stone doors in the middle of each wall. In each corner of the room stands a 10-foot-tall statue of a great serpent, coiled and ready to strike. The eyes in each statue are rubies worth 200 gp apiece.
