## Traits

**Turn Resistance.** The deathlock has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.


## Actions

**Deathly Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) necrotic damage).

**Grave Bolts.** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one or two targets. @h18 (**4d8**) necrotic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become [[restrained]] as shadowy tendrils wrap around it for 1 minute. A [[restrained]] target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
