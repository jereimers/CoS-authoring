## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Ras Nsi wears [[bracers of defense]], wields a [[flame tongue longsword]], and carries a [[sending stones|]] matched to the one carried by the guide Salida (see chapter 1).

**Shapechanger.** Ras Nsi can use his action to polymorph into a Medium snake or back into his yuan-ti form. His statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. He doesn't change form if he dies.

**Magic Resistance.** Ras Nsi has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and Ras Nsi can't constrict another target.
