You tap into your life force to heal yourself. Roll one or two of your unexpended [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]], and regain a number of [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the roll's total plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Those dice are then expended.

The number of unexpended Hit Dice you can roll increases by one for each spell slot level above 2.
