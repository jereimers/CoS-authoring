# K6. Overlook 

Dark clouds overhead drizzle constantly. A flagstone avenue passes between empty outbuildings, leading to a stone-paved overlook. The overlook has a low stone wall adorned with outward-facing gargoyle carvings.

If a character peers over the balcony, read:

A flash of lightning illuminates the dismal village of Barovia, its rooftops visible above a smothering blanket of fog one thousand feet below.

If a character who has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher peers over the wall, add:

<div class="description"><p>Underneath the platform on which you stand, about one hundred feet down, a stone construction protrudes from the cliff face. Three dirt-caked windows are set into it.</p></div>

The windows are so dirty as to be opaque, although a character within reach of one can scrape the dirt away and see a dusty tomb beyond (area K88). Characters who try to reach the windows from the overlook must descend 110 feet and move 20 feet back under the platform. This descent can't be accomplished without the aid of magic or the use of a climber's kit.

Anyone who falls from the overlook plummets 1,000 feet.

## Fortunes of Ravenloft

If your card reading indicates an encounter with Strahd in this area, he is looking out over the balcony.
