# Mage Armor

*1st-level abjuration*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)  
**Duration:** 8 hours

---

You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
