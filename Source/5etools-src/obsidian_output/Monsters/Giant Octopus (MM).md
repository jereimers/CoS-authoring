## Traits

**Hold Breath.** While out of water, the octopus can hold its breath for 1 hour.

**Underwater Camouflage.** The octopus has advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made while underwater.

**Water Breathing.** The octopus can breathe only underwater.


## Actions

**Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the octopus can't use its tentacles on another target.

**Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** A 20-foot-radius cloud of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the Dash action as a bonus action.
