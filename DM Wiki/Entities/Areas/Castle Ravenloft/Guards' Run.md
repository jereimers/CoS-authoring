# K68. Guards' Run

This ten-foot-wide arched corridor is cold and moist. The cold seems to emanate from an open archway in the west wall.

The archway leads to area K69. A door at the north end of the hall opens into area K67. To the south, the hallway ends at the foot of a staircase (area K64) that spirals upward.
