Nonflammable grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]] for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on that save or fall [[Prone|XPHB]].
