## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Thessalar wields a [[+1 dagger]] coated with [[Thessaltoxin|IMR]] (see appendix C).

**Alchemical Homunculus.** Thessalar is accompanied by his [[Thessalar's homunculus|IMR]]. If the [[mending]] spell is cast on it, the homunculus regains `2d6` hit points.

**Healing Toxicity.** Any magic item that restores hit points and can be applied to a piercing or slashing weapon (a potion, an ointment, and so forth) causes a hit with that weapon to deal extra damage to Thessalar equal to the amount the item would normally heal.

**Greater Restoration (1/Day).** Thessalar can cast [[greater restoration]] if he has access to [[Alchemist's Supplies|phb]].


## Actions

**Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target is affected as if by the [[polymorph]] spell, transforming into a random beast or a creature it has seen within the last 24 hours (as chosen by the DM). This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
