# Improved Pact Weapon

You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

In addition, the weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

Finally, the weapon you conjure can be a [[shortbow|phb]], [[longbow|phb]], [[light crossbow|phb]], or [[heavy crossbow|phb]].
