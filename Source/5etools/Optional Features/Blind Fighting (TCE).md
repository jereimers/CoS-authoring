# Blind Fighting

You have [[blindsight]] with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind Cover, even if you're [[blinded]] or in darkness. Moreover, you can see an [[invisible]] creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.
