# Extreme Heat

When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on the save. Creatures that have [[Resistance|XPHB]] or [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Fire damage automatically succeed on the save.
