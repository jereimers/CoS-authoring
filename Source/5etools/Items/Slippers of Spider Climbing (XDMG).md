# Slippers of Spider Climbing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a [[Climb Speed|XPHB]] equal to your [[Speed|XPHB]]. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
