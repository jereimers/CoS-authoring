# Boon of Revelry

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Inspire Dance

You always have the [[Otto's Irresistible Dance|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it that way when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

When you cast the spell, it requires no spell components, and taking damage doesn't break your [[Concentration]] on it.

## Sing Out

While a creature that failed its saving throw against your [[Otto's Irresistible Dance|XPHB]] has the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition from that spell, it can't cast spells with Verbal components, and it sings delightful nonsense if it can sing.
