## Traits

**Young Bronze Dragon.** Suldil is accompanied by a [[young bronze dragon]]. The dragon allows Suldil to use him as a mount.


## Actions

**Bronze Bolt.** Attack (ms,rs) +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d10 + 5**) lightning damage.

**Explosion (1/Day).** Suldil discharges a burst of energy in a 60-foot-radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (**8d10**) lightning damage on failed save, half as much damage on a successful save.


## Bonus Actions

**Mounted.** If Suldil isn't mounted, she can use a bonus action to magically teleport onto her young bronze dragon mount, provided Suldil and the young bronze dragon are on the same plane of existence. When she teleports, Suldil appears astride the young bronze dragon along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying. While mounted and not [[incapacitated]], Suldil can't be surprised, and both her and her mount gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws.
