## Traits

**Flyby.** The observer doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Telepathic Bond.** While the observer is within 1 mile of its creator, it can magically convey what it sees to its creator, and the two can communicate telepathically.

**Unusual Nature.** The observer doesn't need air, food, drink, or sleep.


## Actions

**Shriek.** The observer emits a mechanical shriek until the start of its next turn or until it drops to 0 hit points. This shriek can be heard within a range of 300 feet.
