# Crystal Ball of Telepathy

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [[Scrying|XPHB]] (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast [[Suggestion|XPHB]] (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this [[Suggestion|XPHB]] to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [[Scrying|XPHB]] ends. You can't cast [[Suggestion|XPHB]] in this way again until the next dawn.
