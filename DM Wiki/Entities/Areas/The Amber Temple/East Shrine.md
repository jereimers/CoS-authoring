# X12. East Shrine 

This bare stone room consists of a foyer to the west and a shrine to the east. Four candlesticks lie on the dusty floor of the foyer. In the shrine, fragments of a shattered obsidian statue are scattered in a raised alcove at the eastern end of the chamber. Two pairs of empty alcoves line the north and south walls of the shrine.

The amber golem in area X10 knocked over the candlesticks and pulverized the obsidian statue, which depicted the same nameless god that stands in area X5. Amber doors in the west wall open into area X13.

A secret door is set into the back of one of the alcoves on the north wall. It can be pulled open to area X14.
