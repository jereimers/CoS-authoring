# K46. Parapets

You stand on a ten-foot-wide walkway that encircles most of the keep. The drizzle of rain continues, punctuated by the occasional clap of thunder or stroke of lightning. Far below these parapets are the shining wet cobblestones of the courtyard.

The walkway runs around the front of the upper portion of the keep. Battlemented walkways extend from the keep north, south, and east to the outer walls of the castle as well. (See map 2 for the length and location of the castle walls.) All the windows leading from this area into the keep are shut and locked, but can easily be broken.

If the characters loiter on the parapets or atop the castle walls for more than 5 minutes, they encounter Strahd's animated armor (see appendix D) making the rounds. It patrols the parapets and the outer walls of Ravenloft day and night. Under a darkened sky, characters without darkvision are more likely to hear the clatter of the armor approaching before they can see it.

The armor can't be salvaged if it is reduced to 0 hit points.
