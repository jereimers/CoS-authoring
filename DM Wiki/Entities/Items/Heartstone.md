# What It Is

A heartstone is a rare magical gemstone that serves as a [[Night Hags|night hag]]'s life force and connection to the [[Ethereal Plane]].

# What the Party Knows

From [[Victor Vallakovich]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

- A night hag's heartstone is essential to her power and her ability to travel between the material world and the [[Ethereal Plane]]
- Victor needs a heartstone to perform a ritual described in Mordenkainen's book *Ethereal Entities: Denizens of the Unseen Realm*
- The ritual can temporarily transport living creatures into the Ethereal Plane for up to one hour
- This is the only way the party can enter the Ethereal Plane to rescue [[Stella Wachter]]'s trapped soul
- The ritual must be performed on the night of the full moon ([[Neyavr 8]])
- Obtaining a [[heartstone]] requires either stealing it from a [[Night Hags|night hag]] or killing the hag
- The party suspects [[Morgantha]], who sells [[Dream Pastry|dream pastries]] at the [[Refugee Camp]], is actually a night hag in disguise
