# Opportunity Attack

**Time:** 1 reaction

You can make an Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can see leaves your reach using its action, its [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], its [[Reaction|XPHB]], or one of its speeds. To make the Opportunity Attack, take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to make one melee attack with a weapon or an [[Unarmed Strike|XPHB]] against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.
