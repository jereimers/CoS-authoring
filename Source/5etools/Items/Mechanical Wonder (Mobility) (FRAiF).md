# Mechanical Wonder (Mobility)

*Wondrous Item, Common*

A Mechanical Wonder is a semi-autonomous object imbued with magical power. Mechanical Wonders vary greatly in size and form depending on their function.

A Mechanical Wonder is a dormant object until activated. To activate a Mechanical Wonder, you must wind the wonder with a handheld key unique to that wonder. It takes 1 minute to wind a Mechanical Wonder. While you wind it, you must take the [[Utilize|XPHB]] action each turn.

While inactive, the mobility wonder resembles a metal turtle shell with straps. It is designed to be worn on your back or flank, depending on your anatomy. Once wound, the mobility wonder transforms into a personal transport device and remains active for 24 hours. While active, the mobility wonder increases your [[Speed|XPHB]] to 30 feet. Other creatures can't remove your mobility wonder from you unless you allow it.
