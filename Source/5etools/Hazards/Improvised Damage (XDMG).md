# Improvised Damage

The Improvising Damage table gives guidelines for determining damage on the fly.

**Improvising Damage**

| Damage | Examples |
|---|---|
| **1d10** | Burned by coals, hit by a falling bookcase, pricked by a poison needle |
| **2d10** | Struck by lightning, stumbling into a firepit |
| **4d10** | Hit by falling rubble in a collapsing tunnel, tumbling into a vat of acid |
| **10d10** | Crushed by compacting walls, hit by whirling steel blades, wading through lava |
| **18d10** | Submerged in lava, hit by a crashing flying fortress |
| **24d10** | Tumbling into a vortex of fire on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire|XDMG]], crushed in the jaws of a godlike creature or a moon-size monster |

The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to how deadly these damage amounts are for characters of different levels. Cross-reference a character's level with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of the damage.

**Damage Severity and Level**

| Character Levels | Nuisance | Deadly |
|---|---|---|
| 1–4 | 5 (**1d10**) | 11 (**2d10**) |
| 5–10 | 11 (**2d10**) | 22 (**4d10**) |
| 11–16 | 22 (**4d10**) | 55 (**10d10**) |
| 17–20 | 55 (**10d10**) | 99 (**18d10**) |

Nuisance damage rarely poses a risk of death to characters of the levels shown, but a severely weakened character might be laid low by this damage.

Deadly damage poses a significant threat to characters of the levels shown and could potentially kill such a character that's missing many [[Hit Points|XPHB]].
