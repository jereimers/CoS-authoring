# Hat of Wizardry

*Wondrous Item, Common* *(requires attunement by a wizard)*

This cone-shaped hat is adorned with moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

## Spellcasting Focus

You can use the hat as a [[Spellcasting Focus|XPHB]] for your Wizard spells.

## Unknown Spell

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence ([[Arcana|XPHB]]) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
