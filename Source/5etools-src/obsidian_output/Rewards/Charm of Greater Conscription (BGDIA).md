# Charm of Greater Conscription

*Charm*

While you have this charm, you attract flies. As an action, you activate this charm to summon a [[horned devil]]. This devil appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, obeys your commands begrudgingly, and serves you under protest for 9 days or until it dies, whereupon it disappears. When the devil disappears, this charm vanishes from you.
