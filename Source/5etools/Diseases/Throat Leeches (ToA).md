# Throat Leeches

Minuscule parasites known as throat leeches infect the water in Chult's forests, swamps, and rivers. Any giant or humanoid that swallows tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infested with throat leeches. Immediate symptoms include throat inflammation and shortness of breath. After `1d6` hours, the infected character gains 1 level of [[exhaustion]] that can't be removed (except as described below) until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's [[exhaustion]] increases by 1 level; on a successful save, the creature's [[exhaustion]] decreases by 1 level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [[exhaustion]] below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

Explorers can avoid contracting throat leeches by drinking only rainwater or water that's been boiled or magically purified.
