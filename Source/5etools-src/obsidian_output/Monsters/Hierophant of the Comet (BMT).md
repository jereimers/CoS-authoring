## Traits

**Comet's Voice (1/Day).** The hierophant can cast [[Contact Other Plane]], using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.

**Magic Resistance.** The hierophant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Thought Shield.** The hierophant's thoughts can't be read by any means unless the hierophant allows it.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The hierophant makes two Herald's Axe attacks or three Comet Blast attacks.

**Herald's Axe.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**1d12 + 5**) slashing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) necrotic damage.

**Comet Blast.** Ranged Spell Attack +9 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) force damage.

**All-Consuming Star {@recharge}.** The hierophant conjures a manifestation of the All-Consuming Star: brilliant light and haunting screams that fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the hierophant can see within 60 feet of itself. Each creature within the sphere has the [[blinded]] and [[deafened]] conditions. Each creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (**6d8**) psychic damage and has the [[incapacitated]] condition until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. The manifestation persists until the hierophant dies, has the [[incapacitated]] condition, uses a bonus action to end the effect, or uses this action again.


## Bonus Actions

**Star's Hunger.** The hierophant targets one creature within 30 feet of the center of its All-Consuming Star. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 30 feet toward the center of the All-Consuming Star.
