# Vampiric Touch

*3rd-level necromancy*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes **3d6** Necrotic damage, and you regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 3.
