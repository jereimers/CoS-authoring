## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Galeokaerda has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put her to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The extollant makes two Crimson Bolt attacks.

**Crimson Bolt.** Attack (ms,rs) +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one creature. @h20 (**3d10 + 4**) psychic damage.



## Reactions

**Reflect Agony.** When the extollant is damaged by a creature within 60 feet of it, the creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 16 (**3d10**) psychic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
