## Traits

**Unarmored Defense.** While the tower hand is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The tower hand makes two Unarmed Strike attacks, two Dart attacks, or one of each.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d4 + 2**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Deflect Missile.** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the tower hand deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by 7 (`1d10 + 2`).
