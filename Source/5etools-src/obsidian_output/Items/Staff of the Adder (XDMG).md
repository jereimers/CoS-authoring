# Staff of the Adder

*Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

As a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]], you can turn the head of this staff into that of an animate, venomous snake for 1 minute or revert the staff to its inanimate form.

When you take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the animated snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Apply your [[Proficiency|XPHB]] and Wisdom modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes **1d6** Piercing damage and **3d6** Poison damage.

The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has AC 15, HP 20, and [[Immunity|XPHB]] to Poison and Psychic damage. If the head drops to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost [[Hit Points|XPHB]] when it reverts to its inanimate form.
