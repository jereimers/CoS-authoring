## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the assassin vine remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal plant.


## Actions

**Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. @hThe target takes 11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and it takes 21 (**6d6**) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The vine can constrict only one target at a time.

**Entangling Vines.** The assassin vine can animate normal vines and roots on the ground in a 15-foot square within 30 feet of it. These plants turn the ground in that area into difficult terrain. A creature in that area when the effect begins must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be [[restrained]] by entangling vines and roots. A creature [[restrained]] by the plants can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength ([[Athletics]]) check, freeing itself on a successful check. The effect ends after 1 minute or when the assassin vine dies or uses Entangling Vines again.
