## Traits

**Sunlight Vulnerability.** While in sunlight, the snake has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight. When the snake begins its turn in sunlight, it immediately suffers 10 radiant damage.

**Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the snake to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the snake drops to 1 hit point instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The snake makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with a constrict attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d8 + 4**) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (**5d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h17 (**3d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the creature is [[restrained]] and the snake cannot constrict another target.
