# Who they are
Rictavio, the lone guest of the Blue Water Inn besides the party, is a colorfully dressed half-elf bard who claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land. He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable. 


# What the party knows
- Rictavio came to the inn just a day before the party. 
- He gave his monkey, Piccolo, as a gift to [[Gadof Blinsky]], the toymaker
# Personality
- Flamboyant, showy, ostentatious


# Where we've seen them
- [[Session 09 - Walls Keep Out More Than Wolves]] — he shared the story of Count Belasco (see [[The Ringmaster's Tale]])
