# Potion of Growth

*Item, Uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [[enlarge/reduce]] spell for `1d4` hours (no [[concentration]] required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
