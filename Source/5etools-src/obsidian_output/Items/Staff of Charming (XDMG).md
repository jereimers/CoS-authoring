# Staff of Charming

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties:

- **Cast Spell:** You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast [[Charm Person|XPHB]], [[Command|XPHB]], or [[Comprehend Languages|XPHB]] from it using your spell save DC.
- **Reflect Enchantment:** If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.
- **Resist Enchantment:** If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn.

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d8 + 2` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
