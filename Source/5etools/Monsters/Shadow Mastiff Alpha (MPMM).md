## Traits

**Ethereal Awareness.** The shadow mastiff can see ethereal creatures and objects.

**Sunlight Weakness.** While in bright light created by sunlight, the shadow mastiff has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].

**Terrifying Howl {@recharge}.** The shadow mastiff howls. Any Beast or Humanoid within 300 feet of it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of it for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's save is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any shadow mastiff's Terrifying Howl for the next 24 hours.


## Bonus Actions

**Shadow Blend.** While in dim light or darkness, the shadow mastiff becomes [[invisible]], along with anything it is wearing or carrying. The invisibility lasts until the shadow mastiff uses a bonus action to end it or until the shadow mastiff attacks, is in bright light, or is [[incapacitated]].
