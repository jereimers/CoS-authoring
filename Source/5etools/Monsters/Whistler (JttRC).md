## Traits

**Blurred Form.** Attack rolls against the whistler are made with disadvantage unless the whistler is [[incapacitated]].

**Unusual Nature.** The whistler doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

**Multiattack.** The whistler makes three Psychic Swipe attacks.

**Psychic Swipe.** Melee Spell Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) psychic damage.

**Otherworldly Melody {@recharge 5}.** The whistler telepathically whistles an otherworldly melody into the minds of up to two creatures it can see within range of its telepathy. Each target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 33 (**6d10**) psychic damage and become [[frightened]] of the whistler for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
