## Traits

**Amphibious.** Gar can breathe air and water.

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Gar fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Water Walk.** Gar can stand and move on liquid surfaces as if they were solid ground.

**Watery Fall.** When Gar drops to 0 hit points, his body collapses into a pool of inky water that rapidly disperses. Anything he was wearing or carrying is left behind.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Gar makes two melee attacks, one with his claw and one with [[Drown|PotA]].

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 13). Until the grapple ends, Gar can't attack other creatures with his claw.

**Drown.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) cold damage.
