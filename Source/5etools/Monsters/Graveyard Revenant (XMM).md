## Traits

**Undead Restoration.** If the revenant dies, it revives 24 hours later unless [[Dispel Evil and Good|XPHB]] is cast on its remains. If it revives, it animates another group of corpses elsewhere on the same plane of existence; it now looks different but uses the same stat block and returns with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]].


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The revenant makes two Suffocate attacks.

**Suffocate.** m +8, reach 10 ft. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) Bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) Necrotic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is suffocating. The revenant can have up to two targets [[Grappled|XPHB]] in this way at a time.

**Haunting Glare {@recharge 5}.** wis DC 15, each creature in a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the revenant. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
