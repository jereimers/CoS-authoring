# Hide

**Time:** 1 action

With the Hide action, you try to conceal yourself. To do so, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity ([[Stealth|XPHB]]) check while you're [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]] or behind [[Cover|XPHB]], and you must be out of any enemy's line of sight; if you can see a creature, you can discern whether it can see you.

On a successful check, you have the [[Invisible|XPHB]] condition. Make note of your check's total, which is the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom ([[Perception|XPHB]]) check.

You stop being hidden immediately after any of the following occurs: you make a sound louder than a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.
