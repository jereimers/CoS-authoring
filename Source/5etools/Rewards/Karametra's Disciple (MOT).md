# Karametra's Disciple

*Piety Trait*

*Piety 25+ Karametra trait*

By performing an hour-long ritual, you can conjure enough grapes to fill three vials (4 ounces each) of wine. Each vial serves as a [[potion of healing]] for 24 hours, after which it loses this property. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
