# Sovereign Glue

*Wondrous Item, Legendary*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[Oil of Slipperiness|XDMG]]. When found, a container contains `1d6 + 1` ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of [[Universal Solvent|XDMG]] or [[Oil of Etherealness|XDMG]], or with a [[Wish|XPHB]] spell.
