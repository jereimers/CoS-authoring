You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.

For the duration, the target appears dead to outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] conditions, and its [[Speed|XPHB]] is 0.

The target also has [[Resistance|XPHB]] to all damage except Psychic damage, and it has [[Immunity|XPHB]] to the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition.
