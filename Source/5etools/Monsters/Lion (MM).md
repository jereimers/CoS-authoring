## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The lion has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on smell.

**Pack Tactics.** The lion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the lion's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Pounce.** If the lion moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. If the target is [[prone]], the lion can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.

**Running Leap.** With a 10-foot running start, the lion can long jump up to 25 feet.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) slashing damage.
