# X36. Lower West Hall

Glistening amber coats the walls and ceiling of this enormous hall like sculpted honey, and dust covers the black marble floor. The vaulted ceiling is twenty-five feet high. Set into the walls at a height of five feet are amber ledges lined with life-sized alabaster statues of cats, frogs, hawks, owls, rats, ravens, snakes, toads, and weasels. Many of the statues have fallen off their perches and lie shattered on the floor.

An amber door in the north wall stands open. Four other amber doors to the west and south stand closed.

The animal statues represent different kinds of familiars, and they are harmless.
