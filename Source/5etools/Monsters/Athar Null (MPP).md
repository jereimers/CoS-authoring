## Traits

**Avoidance.** If the null is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take half as much damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half as much damage if it fails.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The null makes two Force Dagger attacks.

**Force Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 13 (**3d8**) force damage. @homThe dagger magically returns to the null's hand immediately after a ranged attack.


## Bonus Actions

**Defier's Whim.** The null takes the Dash, Disengage, or Use an Object action.


## Reactions

**Nullify Spell (3/Day).** The null utters a magical word of cancellation to interrupt a creature it can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 4th level or higher, the null makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a successful check, the spell fails and has no effect.
