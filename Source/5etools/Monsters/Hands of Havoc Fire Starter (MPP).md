## Actions

**Multiattack.** The fire starter makes two Havoc Hammer or Havoc Flask attacks.

**Havoc Hammer.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (**2d8**) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 (**1d6**) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

**Havoc Flask.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d12**) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 (**1d6**) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

After the fire starter throws the flask, roll a `d6`; on a 3 or lower, the fire starter has no more flasks to throw.
