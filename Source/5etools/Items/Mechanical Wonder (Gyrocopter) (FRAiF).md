# Mechanical Wonder (Gyrocopter)

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

A Mechanical Wonder is a semi-autonomous object imbued with magical power. Mechanical Wonders vary greatly in size and form depending on their function.

A Mechanical Wonder is a dormant object until activated. To activate a Mechanical Wonder, you must wind the wonder with a handheld key unique to that wonder. It takes 1 minute to wind a Mechanical Wonder. While you wind it, you must take the [[Utilize|XPHB]] action each turn.

This wagon-sized vehicle is made of brassy metal and has a spiral-shaped propeller atop it. Its midsection is open on two sides. Once wound, the gyrocopter wonder remains active for 8 hours. While active, the gyrocopter can be used as a vehicle; it requires one pilot.

The gyrocopter wonder is a Huge object that weighs 500 pounds and has the following statistics: AC 14, HP 50, [[Speed|XPHB]] 5 ft., and [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] 20 ft. The gyrocopter can bear up to 2,000 pounds of cargo; if it bears any more than this, it deactivates.

Eight spectral cords are mounted to the inside of the cargo bay. A creature riding in the gyrocopter wonder can take a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action to attach itself to or detach itself from one of these cords. A creature attached to a cord can leap from the gyrocopter wonder and glide, moving up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends in the air. If a creature attached to a cord is ever more than 500 feet away from the gyrocopter, the cord immediately disappears and returns to the wonder.
