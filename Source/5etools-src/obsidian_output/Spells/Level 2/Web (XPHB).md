You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] there for the duration. The webs are [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]], and the area within them is [[Lightly Obscured|XPHB]].

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature [[Restrained|XPHB]] by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer [[Restrained|XPHB]].

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing **2d4** Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
