# Wand of Enemy Detection

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to expend 1 charge. For 1 minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature [[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB]] to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of [[Hostile [Attitude]|XPHB]] creatures that are [[Invisible|XPHB]], ethereal, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
