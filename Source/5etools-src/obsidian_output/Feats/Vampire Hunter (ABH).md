# Vampire Hunter

You gain the following benefits.

## Adroit Escape

You have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on checks to escape from nonmagical restraints or the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition.

## Vitality Ward

When you take Necrotic damage, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to mitigate the damage. Roll a number of d6s equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and add them together. Reduce the Necrotic damage you take by this total. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
