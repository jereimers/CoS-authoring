## Traits

**Roleplaying Information.** Beldora is a member of the harpers who survives using her wits and wiles. She looks like a homeless waif, but she's a survivor who shies away from material wealth.

Ideal: "We should all strive to help one another"

Bond: "I'll risk my life to protect the powerless."

Flaw: "I like lying to people. Makes life more interesting, no?"


## Actions

**Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Hand Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage. Beldora carries ten crossbow bolts.



## Reactions

**Duck and Cover.** Beldora adds 2 to her AC against one ranged attack that would hit her. To do so, Beldora must see the attacker and can't be [[grappled]] or [[restrained]].
