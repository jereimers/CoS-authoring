## Traits

**False Appearance.** While the trapper is attached to a ceiling, floor, or wall and remains motionless, it is almost indistinguishable from an ordinary section of ceiling, floor, or wall. A creature that can see it and succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) or Intelligence ([[Nature]]) check can discern its presence.

**Spider Climb.** The trapper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Smother.** One Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of the trapper must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be [[grappled]] (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 17 (**4d6 + 3**) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (**1d6**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. While [[grappled]] in this way, the target is [[restrained]], [[blinded]], and at risk of suffocating. The trapper can smother only one creature at a time.
