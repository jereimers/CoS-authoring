# X38. Haunted Room

This room, once a bedchamber, is littered with broken furnishings. Scattered about the room are the remains of a bed, a wardrobe, two trunks, three tall candlesticks, a desk, a bookshelf, and several chairs. Torn-up books, old quill pens, and tattered clothes are also strewn about.

%% --- Page 268 --- %%
The ceiling here is 10 feet high. A poltergeist (see the specter entry in the Monster Manual) haunts this room and telekinetically hurls broken furnishings at intruders so as not to give away its location.

## Treasure 

A search of the room yields a wooden scroll tube containing an intact spell scroll of wall of fire.
