# Who they are

Sir Godfrey Gwilym is an undead officer of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]], an ancient order of knights who opposed [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] centuries ago. Though the Order was defeated, Sir Godfrey's spirit endures at [[Argynvostholt]], the ruined manor that once served as the Order's headquarters. Unlike many of his fallen brethren, Sir Godfrey retains his honor and his hope that the darkness might one day be overcome.

# What the party knows

- Sir Godfrey can be found at [[Argynvostholt]], a ruined manor to the west
- He awaits those who would raise their swords against the darkness in [[Castle Ravenloft]]
- [[Standimir]] (the revenant at [[Tser Falls]]) mentioned that Sir Godfrey would know more about the "amber doors" spoken of during [[Madam Eva]]'s Tarokka reading
- The [[Order of the Silver Dragon]] was utterly defeated by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] centuries ago

# Personality

- Retains the honor and nobility he possessed in life
- Hopeful that heroes might succeed where his Order failed
- Bound by oaths even in death, though willing to aid those who oppose Strahd
