| d6 | Personality Trait |
|---|---|
| 1 | Is it practical to learn an ancient language that is rarely spoken? No. But is it fun? Very. |
| 2 | I learned one of my ancestors was a lauded rune carver whose story was lost to time. I seek to rekindle that legacy. |
| 3 | The old, traditional markings of runecraft look so boring. Why not give my runes some flair? |
| 4 | In my studies of runes, I strive to understand how great civilizations of the past fell, so I can prevent it from happening to societies of the present. |
| 5 | Life may be a whirlwind of chaos, but whenever I create my runes, I feel at peace. |
| 6 | My brain struggles to process words written in ink, but the feeling of carved runes makes my mind sing. |
