# Red Wizard Blade

*Item, Legendary*

Forged by Red Wizards using a secret process known only to them, this grim steel dagger draws its power from the Negative Plane. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using this magic dagger, the target takes an extra **3d12** necrotic damage.

A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this weapon dies and can't be raised from the dead except by a deity or by a creature using a [[tablet of reawakening|HAT-LMI]] to cast the [[true resurrection]] spell.
