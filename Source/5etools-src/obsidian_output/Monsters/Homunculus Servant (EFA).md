## Traits

**Evasion.** If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the homunculus instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the save and only half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.

**Magic Bond.** Add the spell's level to any ability check or saving throw the homunculus makes.


## Actions

**Force Strike.** m,r Bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft. @h`1d6 + summonSpellLevel` Force damage.



## Reactions

**Channel Magic.** @actTrigger You cast a spell that has a range of touch while the homunculus is within 120 feet of you. @actResponse The homunculus delivers the spell through its touch.
