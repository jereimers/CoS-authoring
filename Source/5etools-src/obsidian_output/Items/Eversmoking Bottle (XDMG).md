# Eversmoking Bottle

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can open or close this bottle.

Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]].

Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.

Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the [[Gust of Wind|XPHB]] spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.
