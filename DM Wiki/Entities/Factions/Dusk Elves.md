# What They Are

The dusk elves are a diminished community of elves who live in hovels below the [[Vistani Camp]] outside [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. They are the last remnants of a once-proud people who suffered a terrible tragedy.

# What the Party Knows

From [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]], the party learned:

## Their Current Situation

- The dusk elves live in simple hovels below the Vistani Camp, maintaining a peaceful coexistence with the [[Vistani]]
- They serve as scouts and trackers, helping search the wilderness for [[Arabelle]]
- [[Savid]], a dusk elf scout, was the one who found [[Yan]]'s body at the [[Luna River]] crime scene
- The dusk elves joined the Vistani in searching for Arabelle, with nearly as many dusk elf scouts as Vistani joining the search parties

## Kasimir's Tale

[[Kasimir Velikov]], the dusk elves' leader and foremost scholar, shared their tragic history:

### The Ancient Past

- Over four centuries ago, the dusk elves lived in [[Barovia]] as a proud and prosperous people
- They possessed great knowledge of magic and arcane lore
- Kasimir's sister [[Patrina Velikovna]] was a powerful mage and one of the brightest minds among her people

### The Terrible Betrayal

- Patrina became obsessed with [[Source/CoS-Reloaded/Chapter 2 - The Land of Barovia/Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd von Zarovich]] and his dark powers
- She offered herself to Strahd as his bride, hoping to share in his immortality
- Strahd accepted Patrina's offer, intending to make her his vampiric consort
- The dusk elves feared this union would doom their entire people to darkness

### The Stoning

- To prevent the unholy wedding, the dusk elves decided Patrina must die
- In a desperate act, they stoned Patrina to death
- Kasimir himself threw the first stone, though it tore his heart to do so
- The dusk elves believed they were saving their people from corruption

### Strahd's Revenge

- Strahd was enraged by Patrina's murder
- In retaliation, he ordered the deaths of all female dusk elves
- Strahd's forces slaughtered every woman and girl among the dusk elves
- Kasimir bears scars on his face from trying to protect the female members of his family during the massacre
- The dusk elves have been unable to have children ever since, condemning them to slow extinction

## Their Present

- [[Kasimir Velikov]] is their leader, scholar, and keeper of their history
- The dusk elves are a dying people—all male, unable to reproduce, aging toward extinction
- Despite their tragedy, they maintain their dignity and continue to help others, like searching for Arabelle
- They live peacefully alongside the Vistani, who seem to respect their plight

## Kasimir's Role

- Kasimir is a wise and melancholic figure who carries the weight of his people's history
- He identified the magical schools (necromancy and evocation) in Khazan's sigil on the platinum ring
- He lives alone in a hovel, surrounded by books and the remnants of his people's knowledge
- The party has found him to be helpful and willing to share information, despite his sorrowful burden
