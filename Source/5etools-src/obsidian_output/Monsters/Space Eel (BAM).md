## Traits

**Unusual Nature.** The eel doesn't require air.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** If it isn't attached to a creature, the eel makes one Bite attack and one Tail Spine attack.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage, and the eel attaches to the target. While attached, the eel can't make Bite attacks. Instead, the target takes 4 (**1d6 + 1**) piercing damage at the start of each of the eel's turns. The eel can detach itself as a bonus action. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the eel.

**Tail Spine.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h3 (**1d4 + 1**) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is [[paralyzed]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
