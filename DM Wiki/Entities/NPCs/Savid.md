# Who They Are

Savid is a [[Dusk Elves|dusk elf]] guard at the [[Vistani Camp]] outside [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], living in one of the hovels built into the hillside below the main Vistani encampment.

# What the Party Knows

- Savid was the first guard the party encountered when approaching the [[Vistani Camp]] in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]]
- He has the characteristic dusky skin and violet eyes of the dusk elves
- When the party explained they carried a gift for a Vistani girl, Savid's expression darkened
- He winced and gave them a grim smirk that held no humor
- He directed them up the hill to the large central tent where [[Luvash]] could be found
- His tone suggested [[Luvash]] was "not in the best of moods"—a significant understatement
- Savid was the one who discovered [[Yan]]'s decapitated body near the [[Luna River]], at the site where [[Arabelle]] was abducted
- He found signs of a violent struggle at the crime scene

# Appearance in Sessions

- [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found#Visiting the Vistani|Session 13]] — The party met Savid at the entrance to the [[Vistani Camp]]; learned he discovered [[Yan]]'s body
