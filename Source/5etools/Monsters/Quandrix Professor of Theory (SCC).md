## Actions

**Multiattack.** The professor makes two Heuristic Lance attacks. It can also use Overriding Theorem, if available.

**Heuristic Lance.** Attack (ms,rs) +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one creature. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) psychic damage, and the target is [[poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.

**Overriding Theorem {@recharge 4}.** The professor magically influences the mind of up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or become [[charmed]] by the professor until the start of the professor's next turn. The [[charmed]] creature must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move up its speed toward another creature of the professor's choice and make one melee attack against that other creature.



## Reactions

**Divide by Zero (2/Day).** When the professor sees another creature within 60 feet of itself casting a spell, the professor can try to nullify the spell's formation. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 saving throw using the spell's spellcasting ability, or the spell fails and is wasted.
