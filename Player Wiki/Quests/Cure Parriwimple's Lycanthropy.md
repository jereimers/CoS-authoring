# Objective

Cure Parriwimple of his lycanthropy, ideally before the next full moon on the night of [[Neyavr 8]].
# What the Party knows

- Parriwimple was bitten by a werewolf (aur naur) back in [[Session 08 - Hairy Bill, Bairy Hill, and a Coin for the Ladies Three#Lake Zarovich and the Werewolf Attack|Session 8]] (on Neyavr 1) and has almost certainly contracted lycanthropy, but you won't know for sure until the next full moon (Neyavr 8). 
- According to [[A Study of the Werewolf's Curse]] (obtained from [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] in [[Session 06 - The Game of Stories|Session 6]]), Parriwimple will be forcibly transformed into a werewolf on the night of the next full moon, regardless of whether he resists the curse's influence.
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] admitted that the removal of such a curse is beyond his powers, but that [[The Abbot]] at the [[Abbey of St. Markovia]] in [[Village of Krezk|Krezk]] is known to wield extremely powerful healing magics. 
- There might be other remedies which could lessen the effects of the transformation.
