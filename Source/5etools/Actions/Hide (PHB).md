# Hide

**Time:** 1 action

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in [[chapter 7|phb]] for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "[[Unseen Attackers and Targets|PHB]]" section in the Player's Handbook.
