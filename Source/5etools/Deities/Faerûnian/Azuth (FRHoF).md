# Azuth

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Renowned as the right hand of Mystra and the First Magister, Azuth is a god of spells and spellcraft. Where Mystra is a god of magic in all its forms and manifestations, Azuth is the lord of spellcasting, the Art of giving shape to the raw power of [[the Weave|FRHoF]]. As the Aphorism of the High One says, "Where Mystra is force, Azuth grants form." His priests claim that spellcasters who meditate on the Aphorism reach new understanding of the Art.

The myths of Azuth portray the First Magister as being deeply in love with Mystra, which his priests say isn't idle gossip but the proper approach of any magic-user to magic itself: the Art must be wooed and treated with equal parts adoration and reverence, cultivated like a lifelong love. But Azuth is less concerned with good and evil than Mystra, and he tolerates evil spellcasters as long as they don't deceive or spread chaos. Azuth is friendly with Oghma, who shares his neutral outlook. Azuth wields the *Old Staff*, an Artifact of incalculable arcane power marked with sigils and topped by a shape-changing crystal. He communicates with his worshipers through a manifestation of the [[Magic Mouth|XPHB]] spell with a gray beard and mustache, by sending a gray animal such as a cat or owl, or—in extreme cases—a sphinx.

Azuth has few dedicated temples, but every temple to Mystra contains at least one shrine to Azuth within it or a chapel dedicated to him. His priests, the magistrati, host magic fairs and collect rare and unusual [[Spell Scroll|XDMG]] so the death of a spell's inventor doesn't leave their creation lost to time. Magistrati give away spellbooks to people with the potential to become spellcasters but who can't afford to pursue their study. Some magistrati teach at schools of magic. Azuth's priests spread and enforce the magebond, a social covenant among Faerûn's spellcasters. The magebond stipulates that personal disputes between spellcasters shouldn't attract the attention of or disturb mundane society. It encourages spellcasters to handle such issues among themselves, preferably in a peaceful way.

Azuth's Chosen are called his Favored; they push the limits of magical research and arcane innovation, creating new ways to interact with and strengthen the Weave.
