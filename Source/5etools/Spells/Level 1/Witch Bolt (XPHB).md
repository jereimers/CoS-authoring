# Witch Bolt

*1st-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a twig struck by lightning)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

A beam of crackling energy lances toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes **2d12** Lightning damage.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to deal **1d12** Lightning damage to the target automatically, even if the first attack missed.

The spell ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has Total [[Cover|XPHB]] from you.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The initial damage increases by `2d12` for each spell slot level above 1.
