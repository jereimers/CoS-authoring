## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Spider Climb.** The dragon can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Tunneler.** The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and can leave a 20-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d10 + 8**) piercing damage plus 11 (**2d10**) thunder damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d6 + 8**) slashing damage.

**Debilitating Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales a pulse of high-pitched, nearly inaudible sound in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 55 (**10d10**) thunder damage and is [[incapacitated]] until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[incapacitated]].


## Bonus Actions

**Change Shape.** The dragon magically transforms into any creature that is Medium or Small, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.

**Psychic Step.** The dragon magically teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of it.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Claw.** The dragon makes one Claw attack.

**Psionics (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon uses Psychic Step or Spellcasting.

**Telekinetic Fling (Costs 3 Actions).** The dragon chooses one Medium or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried that it can see within 60 feet of it, and it magically hurls the object at a creature it can see within 60 feet of the object. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 42 (**12d6**) bludgeoning damage.
