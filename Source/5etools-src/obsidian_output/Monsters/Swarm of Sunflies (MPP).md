## Traits

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny dragonfly. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.


## Actions

**Stings.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. @h10 (**3d4 + 3**) piercing damage, or 5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. Additionally, if the swarm is on an Outer Plane, it injects the target with a toxin, the effect of which is determined by the swarm's location:

**Upper Plane.** The target sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius until the end of its next turn. During that time, the [[invisible]] condition has no effect on it.

**Neutral Plane.** If the target is [[concentration]] on a spell or similar effect, it loses its [[concentration]].

**Lower Plane.** The target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

**Dazzling Lights {@recharge}.** The swarm shines its lights in a dazzling display. Each creature within 15 feet of the swarm must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or have the [[stunned]] condition for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Bonus Actions

**Illumination.** The swarm sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or it uses a bonus action to extinguish the light.
