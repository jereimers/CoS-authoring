# Tortle

**Size:** Small, Medium  
**Speed:** 30  

## Size

You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.

## Claws

You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals **1d6** + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

## Hold Breath

You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.

## Natural Armor

Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can't wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.

## Nature's Intuition

Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: [[Animal Handling]], [[Medicine]], [[Nature]], [[Perception]], [[Stealth]], or [[Survival]].

## Shell Defense

You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are [[prone]], your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.
