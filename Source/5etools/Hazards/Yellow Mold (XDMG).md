# Yellow Mold

Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of spores that fills a 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (**2d10**) Poison damage and have the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. While Poisoned in this way, the creature takes 5 (**1d10**) Poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Direct sunlight or any amount of Fire damage destroys a patch of yellow mold.
