## Traits

**Aura of Terror.** When a hostile creature within 5 feet of the black gauntlet makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it has disadvantage on the roll. Creatures that are immune to the [[frightened]] condition are immune to this trait.

**Tactical Discipline.** The black gauntlet has advantage on all ability checks and saving throws made during combat.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The black gauntlet makes two attacks with its mace.

**Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (**3d8**) necrotic damage.

**Guiding Bolt (1st-Level Spell; Requires a Spell Slot).** Ranged Spell Attack +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. @h14 (**4d6**) radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against the target before the end of the black gauntlet's next turn has advantage. If the black gauntlet casts this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by **1d6** for each slot level above 1st.
