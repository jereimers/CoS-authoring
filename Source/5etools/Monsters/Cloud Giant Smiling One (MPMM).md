## Traits

**Control Weather (8th-level Spell).** The giant can cast the [[control weather]] spell, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two Slam attacks or two Telekinetic Strike attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d8 + 8**) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (**1d10**) psychic damage.

**Telekinetic Strike.** Ranged Spell Attack +7 to hit, range 240 ft., one target. @h25 (**4d10 + 3**) force damage.

**Change Shape.** The giant magically transforms to look and feel like a Beast or a Humanoid it has seen or to return to its true form. Any equipment the giant is wearing or carrying is absorbed by the new form. Its statistics, other than its size, don't change. It reverts to its true form if it dies.


## Bonus Actions

**Cloud Step {@recharge 4}.** The giant teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
