## Actions

**Tentacles.** m +5, reach 10 ft. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 13) from all eight tentacles. While [[Grappled|XPHB]], the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition.



## Reactions

The [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is [[Heavily Obscured|XPHB]] for 1 minute or until a strong current or similar effect disperses the ink.
