## Traits

**Death Burst.** When the spirit statue is reduced to 0 hit points, the statue crumbles, and the spirit returns to the afterlife in a burst of ghostly white flame. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (**1d6**) radiant damage.


## Actions

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage.

**Counsel of the Past (2/Day).** The spirit statue touches one creature. Once within the next 10 minutes, that creature can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice, immediately after rolling the `d20`.
