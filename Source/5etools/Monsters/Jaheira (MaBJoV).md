## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Jaheira has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put Jaheira to sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Jaheira makes three Quarterstaff attacks.

**Quarterstaff.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (**6d6**) thunder damage.

**Cleansing Plague {@recharge}.** Jaheira targets a creature she can see within 60 feet and causes a swarm of flying insects to cover the creature. The creature must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (**8d10**) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails their saving throw they are also [[blinded]] until the end of their next turn.


## Bonus Actions

**Mighty Summons (1/Day).** Jaheira summons three CR 2 Beasts or six CR 1 Beasts. These summoned creatures have maximum hit points and the damage they inflict is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage.
