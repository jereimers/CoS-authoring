# Frightful Presence

*Draconic Gift*

Echoes of a dragon's might linger around you, and you can call on them to inspire fear in those who stand against you.

As a bonus action, you can manifest your frightful presence. Each creature of your choice that is within 120 feet of you and aware of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. A creature that fails becomes [[frightened]] of you for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
