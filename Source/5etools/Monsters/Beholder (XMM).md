## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day, or 4/Day in Lair).** If the beholder fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The beholder uses Eye Rays three times.

**Bite.** m +8, reach 5 ft. @h13 (**3d6 + 3**) Piercing damage.

**Eye Rays.** The beholder randomly shoots one of the following magical rays at a target it can see within 120 feet of itself (roll `1d10`; reroll if the beholder has already used that ray during this turn):

- **1: Charm Ray:** wis DC 16. @actSaveFail 13 (**3d8**) Psychic damage, and the target has the [[Charmed|XPHB]] condition for 1 hour or until it takes damage. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
- **2: Paralyzing Ray:** con DC 16. @actSaveFail The target has the [[Paralyzed|XPHB]] condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
- **3: Fear Ray:** wis DC 16. @actSaveFail 14 (**4d6**) Psychic damage, and the target has the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the end of its next turn. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
- **4: Slowing Ray:** con DC 16. @actSaveFail 18 (**4d8**) Necrotic damage. Until the end of the target's next turn, the target's [[Speed|XPHB]] is halved; the target can't take Reactions; and it can take either an action or a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] on its turn, not both. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
- **5: Enervation Ray:** con DC 16. @actSaveFail 13 (**3d8**) Poison damage, and the target has the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition until the end of its next turn. While [[Poisoned|XPHB]], the target can't regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
- **6: Telekinetic Ray:** str DC 16 (the target succeeds automatically if it is Gargantuan). @actSaveFail The beholder moves the target up to 30 feet in any direction. The target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder has the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a tool or opening a door or container.
- **7: Sleep Ray:** wis DC 16 (the target succeeds automatically if it is a Construct or an Undead). @actSaveFail The target has the [[Unconscious|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. The condition ends if the target takes damage or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it.
- **8: Petrification Ray:** con DC 16. 1 The target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still [[Restrained|XPHB]], ending the effect on itself on a success. 2 The target has the [[Petrified|XPHB]] condition instead of the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition.
- **9: Disintegration Ray:** dex DC 16. @actSaveFail 36 (**8d8**) Force damage. If the target is a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force, a 10-foot [[Cube [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] of it disintegrates into dust. @actSaveSuccess Half damage. @actSaveSuccessOrFail If the target is a creature and this damage reduces it to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]], it disintegrates into dust.
- **10: Death Ray:** dex DC 16. @actSaveFail 55 (**10d10**) Necrotic damage. @actSaveSuccess Half damage. @actSaveSuccessOrFail The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].


## Bonus Actions

**Antimagic Cone.** The beholder's central eye emits an antimagic wave in a 150-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Until the start of the beholder's next turn, that area acts as an [[Antimagic Field|XPHB]] spell, and that area works against the beholder's own Eye Rays.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Chomp.** The beholder makes two Bite attacks.

**Glare.** The beholder uses Eye Rays.
