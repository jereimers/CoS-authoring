# Sleigh Boots

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

These worn leather boots are reinforced with strips of metal along the soles, curving upward at the toes like the runners of a sleigh. Faint frost patterns are etched into the leather, and they emit a soft chill when worn. [[The Grinch]] crafted them for traversing the icy slopes of [[Mt Crumpit]], though they function equally well on any frozen terrain.

## Appearance

The boots are practical rather than elegant—clearly hand-crafted by someone more concerned with function than aesthetics. The leather is cracked and weathered, stained by years of use. Despite their worn appearance, the metalwork is precise and well-maintained, evidence of the Grinch's artificer skills.

## What the Party Knows

The party may find these boots in the Grinch's Workshop or receive them as a gift if the Grinch is redeemed. A DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies their magical properties.

# Sleigh Boots

## Description
These weathered leather boots have metal runners along the soles, resembling miniature sleigh blades. Frost patterns shimmer faintly across the leather. When worn, the wearer feels a pleasant chill that never becomes uncomfortable.

## Mechanics

### Properties

While wearing these boots:

- **Ice Walk:** You can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.

- **Sleigh Slide (3 charges):** As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to gain the following benefits until the end of your turn:
  - Your movement speed increases by 20 feet
  - You do not provoke opportunity attacks
  - You must end your movement on solid ground or fall prone
  
  The boots regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

- **Cold Resistance (Passive):** While wearing these boots on snow or ice, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws against extreme cold.

### Limitations
- The Sleigh Slide only functions on surfaces covered in snow, ice, or frost
- In warm environments (above 60°F), the boots lose their magical properties until returned to cold conditions

## Lore Flavor

The Grinch crafted these boots decades ago, when he first claimed [[Mt Crumpit]] as his home. The icy slopes that keep intruders at bay are trivial obstacles for him—thanks in part to these boots. He has made several pairs over the years, improving the design each time. This pair represents his most refined work.

## Balance Notes

**Intended Level:** 5+

**Power Assessment:** Situationally powerful, balanced by environmental requirements
- Ice Walk is excellent in cold environments but useless in temperate ones
- Sleigh Slide provides strong mobility but requires specific terrain
- The charge limit (3/day) prevents overuse
- No attunement required, making them easy to use but not a permanent power boost

**Comparison:** Similar in power to *Boots of Elvenkind* or *Boots of Striding and Springing*

## Alternate Versions

### Cursed: Boots of Bitter Cold
*Wondrous item, uncommon (cursed)*

These boots appear identical to normal Sleigh Boots. They function as described above, but with the following curse:

- **Curse:** Once worn, these boots cannot be removed except by *Remove Curse* or similar magic. While wearing them:
  - You take 1d4 cold damage at the start of each turn spent in warm environments
  - You feel compelled to avoid celebrations and gatherings (DC 14 Wisdom save to enter a building where a celebration is occurring)
  - You develop a persistent feeling of loneliness and bitterness

### Improved: Boots of the Winter's End
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

An upgraded version crafted by a redeemed Grinch, or recovered from deeper within the Mist-pocket:

- All properties of normal Sleigh Boots
- **Sleigh Slide:** 5 charges instead of 3; functions on any solid surface
- **Cold Immunity:** While attuned, you are immune to cold damage
- **Create Ice (1/day):** As an action, you can freeze a 20-foot radius of ground centered on yourself. The area becomes difficult terrain for creatures without Ice Walk. The ice lasts for 1 hour or until melted.

## Notes
- The Sleigh Boots are designed as a thematic reward for engaging with the Grinch content
- They are most useful in Act II (Vallaki and surroundings) where cold environments are common
- The cursed version can create interesting roleplay if the party doesn't identify the curse
- The improved version is appropriate as a reward for redeeming the Grinch
