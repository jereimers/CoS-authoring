You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Whenever the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes **4d6** Psychic damage and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition, and you can push it up to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.
