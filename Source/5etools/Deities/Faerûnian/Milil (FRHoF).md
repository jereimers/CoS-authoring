# Milil

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Milil is a god of poetry, eloquence, and song. He is also a god of creativity and inspiration, of the essence of song beyond the lyrics or the music.

Like Deneir, Milil defers to Oghma's will, and he is sometimes thought of as Oghma's left hand. Milil is the ideal to which performers aspire: poised and confident, winningly charismatic, and a source of inspiration. Songbirds are heralds of Milil. He manifests to mortals as a beautiful, haunting voice echoing through open spaces or through visions that appear to entertainers during performances.

Milil is venerated by bards, troubadours, and other entertainers, but anyone preparing to entertain or speak before a crowd might pray to Milil for a successful performance. Milil's followers need not be entertainers themselves, but simply appreciate good music. His followers tend to be hedonistic in comparison to those of other gods. Milil's most daring followers become tuneservants, traveling with adventuring parties and composing ballads detailing the group's heroics. Fanciful gold netting is a hallmark of tuneservant attire; tuneservants drape this netting around their shoulders or use it to hold up their hair.

Worshipers dedicate holy sites to Milil in performance venues and music schools. Whether the site is a vast concert hall or a small choral chamber, it must have excellent acoustic qualities. Milil's priests are patrons of the arts, performers, and tutors. Each year on [[Midsummer|FRHoF]], priests of Milil hold a holiday called the Grand Revel. In this ceremony, clergy and other followers of Milil dance, feast, act out parodies, and join in wickedly satirical song. Though it isn't an expressly political event, those in power are the revel's biggest targets. For this reason, tyrannical rulers outlaw the Grand Revel—though priests of Milil still conduct it in small, private ceremonies.

Milil's Chosen have angelic voices that resonate far beyond those of most mortals. Their passionate words can crack the hardest of hearts, whether through song or oration.
