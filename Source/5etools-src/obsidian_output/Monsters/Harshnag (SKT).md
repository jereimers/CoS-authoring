## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (1/Day).** If Harshnag fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Weighted Net.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, ranged 20/60 ft., one Small, Medium, or Large creature. @hThe target is [[restrained]] until it escapes the net. Any creature can use its action to make a DC 17 Strength check to free itself or another creature in the net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) destroys the net and frees the target.

**Multiattack.** The giant makes two greataxe attacks.

**Gurt's Greataxe.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h26 (**3d12 + 7**) slashing damage, or 39 (**5d12 + 7**) slashing damage if the target is human.

**Rock.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. @h28 (**4d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage.
