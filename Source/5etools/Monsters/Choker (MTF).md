**Aberrant Quickness (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The choker can take an extra action on its turn.

**Boneless.** The choker can move through and occupy a space as narrow as 4 inches wide without squeezing.

**Spider Climb.** The choker can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The choker makes two tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (**1d6**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the choker can't use this tentacle on another target. The choker has two tentacles. If this attack is a critical hit, the target also can't breathe or speak until the grapple ends.
