## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** Oak has advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], and magic can't put him to sleep.

**Keen Hearing and Sight.** Oak has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on hearing or sight.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Oak makes three attacks with his hooked daggers or his hand crossbow.

**Hooked Dagger.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage.

**Hand Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage.



## Reactions

**Return the Favor (3/Day).** When Oak takes damage from a melee weapon attack, he can make a hooked dagger attack.
