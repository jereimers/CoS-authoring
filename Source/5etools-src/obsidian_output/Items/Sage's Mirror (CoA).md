# Sage's Mirror

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This item has 3 charges and regains all charges at dusk. You can use an action and expend 1 of the mirror's charges to cast one of the following spells:

- [[Find the Path]]
- [[Legend Lore]]

With each use, it is apparent that the information gleaned from the mirror comes from a chamber in the Nine Hells where sages and scholars are tortured for the answers to each question.
