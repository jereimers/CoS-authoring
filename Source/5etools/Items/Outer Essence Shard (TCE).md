# Outer Essence Shard

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement by a sorcerer)*

This flickering crystal holds the essence of an Outer Plane. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

Roll a `d4` and consult the Outer Essence Shards table to determine the shard's essence and property. When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can use that property.

**Outer Essence Shards**

| d4 | Property | Shard |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Lawful | [[Outer Essence Shard (Lawful)|TCE]] |
| 2 | Chaotic | [[Outer Essence Shard (Chaotic)|TCE]] |
| 3 | Good | [[Outer Essence Shard (Good)|TCE]] |
| 4 | Evil | [[Outer Essence Shard (Evil)|TCE]] |
