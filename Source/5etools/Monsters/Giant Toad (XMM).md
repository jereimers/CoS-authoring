## Traits

**Amphibious.** The toad can breathe air and water.

**Standing Leap.** The toad's [[Long Jump|XPHB]] is up to 20 feet and its [[High Jump|XPHB]] is up to 10 feet with or without a running start.


## Actions

**Bite.** m +4, reach 5 ft. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) Piercing damage plus 5 (**2d4**) Poison damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 12).

**Swallow.** The toad swallows a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. While swallowed, the target isn't [[Grappled|XPHB]] but has the [[Blinded|XPHB]] and [[Restrained|XPHB]] conditions, and it has [[Cover|XPHB]] against attacks and other effects outside the toad. In addition, the target takes 10 (**3d6**) Acid damage at the end of each of the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time, and it can't use Bite while it has a swallowed target. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[Restrained|XPHB]] and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.
