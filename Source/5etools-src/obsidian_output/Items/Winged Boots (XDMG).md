# Winged Boots

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

These boots have 4 charges and regain `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the boots, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to expend 1 charge, gaining a [[Fly Speed|XPHB]] of 30 feet for 1 hour. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.
