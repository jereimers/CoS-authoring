# Actor

**Prerequisites:** Level 4, CHA 13+

You gain the following benefits.

## Impersonation

While you're disguised as a real or fictional person, you have [[Advantage|XPHB]] on Charisma ([[Deception|XPHB]] or [[Performance|XPHB]]) checks to convince others that you are that person.

## Mimicry

You can mimic the sounds of other creatures, including speech. A creature that hears the mimicry must succeed on a Wisdom ([[Insight|XPHB]]) check to determine the effect is faked (DC 8 plus your Charisma modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]).
