# Sling Bullets of Althemone

*Item, Very Rare*

The sling bullets come in a pouch, which contains `1d4 + 4` bullets. Roll on the Magic Sling Bullets table for each bullet to determine its magical property.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with each of these bullets. If a bullet misses its target, the bullet teleports back into the pouch. Once a bullet hits a target, the bullet loses its magic.

**Magic Sling Bullets**

| d4 | Bullet |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Banishment.** A creature that takes damage from this bullet must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished as though affected by the [[banishment]] spell. |
| 2 | **Fulguration.** On a hit, this bullet deals an extra **2d8** lightning damage to its target. All other creatures within 10 feet of the target must each succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take **1d8** thunder damage. |
| 3 | **Stunning.** On a hit, this bullet deals an extra **1d10** force damage, and the target is [[stunned]] until the end of your next turn. |
| 4 | **Tracking.** A creature that takes damage from this bullet is marked with a glowing rune where the bullet hit. The mark lasts 24 hours. While the creature is marked, you always know the direction to it. |
