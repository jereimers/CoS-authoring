## Traits

**Limited Telepathy.** The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The neo-otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [[poisoned]] until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (`1d10`) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. @h10 (**1d10 + 5**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16) and [[restrained]] until the grapple ends. The neo-otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Tentacle Slam.** The neo-otyugh slams creatures [[grappled]] by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 15 (**3d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage and be [[stunned]] until the end of the neo-otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't [[stunned]].
