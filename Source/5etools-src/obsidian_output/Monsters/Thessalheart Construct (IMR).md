## Traits

**Telepathic Bond.** While the construct is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically.


## Actions

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h1 slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instead [[poisoned]] for 5 (`1d10`) minutes and [[unconscious]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.
