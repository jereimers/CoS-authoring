# Compelled Duel

*1st-level enchantment*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus  
**Range:** 30 feet  
**Components:** V  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

---

You try to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it can't willingly move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you.

The spell ends if you make an attack roll against a creature other than the target, if you cast a spell on an enemy other than the target, if an ally of yours damages the target, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
