## Actions

**Blood Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage, and the stirge attaches to the target. While attached, the stirge doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the stirge's turns, the target loses 5 (`1d4 + 3`) hit points due to blood loss.

The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the stirge.
