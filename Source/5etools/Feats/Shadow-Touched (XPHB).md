# Shadow-Touched

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

Your exposure to the Shadowfell's magic grants you the following benefits.

## Shadow Magic

Choose one level 1 spell from the Illusion or Necromancy school of magic. You always have that spell and the [[Invisibility|XPHB]] spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.
