## Traits

**Joyful Presence.** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[charmed]] by the eladrin for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Joyful Presence for 24 hours.

Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the [[charmed]] creature, the [[charmed]] creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Magic Resistance.** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The eladrin makes two Longsword or Longbow attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d8 + 2**) slashing damage, or 7 (**1d10 + 2**) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 22 (**5d8**) psychic damage.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) piercing damage plus 22 (**5d8**) psychic damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Fey Step {@recharge 4}.** The eladrin teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
