# Tinderbox

*Item, None*

A Tinderbox is a small container holding flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a [[Candle|XPHB]], [[Lamp|XPHB]], [[Hooded Lantern|XPHB]], or [[Torch|XPHB]]—or anything else with exposed fuel—takes a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]]. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.
