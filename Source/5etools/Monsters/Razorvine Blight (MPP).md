## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the blight is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. If a creature hasn't observed the blight move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the blight is animate.

**Spider Climb.** The blight can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The blight makes two Claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit (with advantage if the target is missing any of its hit points), reach 10 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) slashing damage.

**Life-Draining Vines {@recharge}.** Snaking vines erupt from the blight. Each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (**2d8**) slashing damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If at least one of the creatures that failed this save isn't a Construct or an Undead, the blight regains 9 hit points.
