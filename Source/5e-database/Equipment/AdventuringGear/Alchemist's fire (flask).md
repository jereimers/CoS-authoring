# Alchemist's fire (flask)

*Adventuring Gear*

**Cost:** 50 gp
**Weight:** 1 lb.

This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air.

As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon.

On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
