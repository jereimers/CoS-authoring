## Traits

**Fiendish Blessing.** The AC of the cambion includes its Charisma bonus.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The cambion makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.

**Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d6 + 4**) piercing damage, or 8 (**1d8 + 4**) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (**1d6**) fire damage.

**Fire Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. @h10 (**3d6**) fire damage.

**Fiendish Charm.** One humanoid the cambion can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[charmed]] for 1 day. The [[charmed]] target obeys the cambion's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.
