# Recognized in House

When you request a favor from your house (as decribed under "[[Favored in House|EFA]]"), it can take one of the following additional forms:

- A dragonmarked member of the house casts for you a level 2 spell associated with the house's mark at no cost.
- A member of the house casts for you a different spell of level 4 or lower at half the usual cost.
- Whenever you take a Bastion turn, you can issue an order to your house as if it were a special facility in your Bastion. Your house determines the type of special facility available to you, as noted in each house's description later in this chapter.

In addition, your house stipend increases to support your Comfortable lifestyle (2 GP per day).
