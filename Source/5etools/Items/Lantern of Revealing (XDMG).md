# Lantern of Revealing

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 30 feet. [[Invisible|XPHB]] creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's [[Bright Light|XPHB]]. You can take a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern's light to [[Dim Light|XPHB]] in a 5-foot radius.
