## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** The hound has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the hound's allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally doesn't have the [[incapacitated]] condition.

**Supernatural Tracker.** The hound knows the distance to and direction of any creature that has come within 30 feet of it, even if that creature is on a different plane of existence. If the creature being tracked by the hound dies, the hound knows.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 3 (**1d6**) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.


## Bonus Actions

**Shadow Step {@recharge 4}.** The hound magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 40 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
