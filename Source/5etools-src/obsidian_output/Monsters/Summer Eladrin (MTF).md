## Traits

**Fearsome Presence.** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Fearsome Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Fey Step {@recharge 4}.** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

**Magic Resistance.** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The eladrin makes two weapon attacks.

**Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) slashing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) fire damage, or 15 (**2d10 + 4**) slashing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) fire damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +9 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) fire damage.



## Reactions

**Parry.** The eladrin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the eladrin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
