# Simbul's Synostodweomer

*7th-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** 1 hour

You imbue one creature you touch with magical healing energy for the duration. Whenever the target casts a spell using a spell slot, the target can immediately roll a number of unexpended [[Hit Point Dice|XPHB]] equal to the spell slot's level and regain [[Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to the roll's total plus your spellcasting ability modifier; those dice are then expended.
