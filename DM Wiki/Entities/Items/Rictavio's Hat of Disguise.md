# Rictavio's Hat of Disguise

## Description
This **hat of disguise** is worn by [[Rudolph van Richten]], the legendary vampire hunter who operates in Barovia under the alias "Rictavio." The hat allows him to maintain his disguise as a colorful half-elf carnival ringmaster, hiding his true identity from Strahd and his spies.

Van Richten uses this magical hat in conjunction with his [[Rictavio's Ring of Mind Shielding|ring of mind shielding]] to maintain his cover while he waits for the opportune moment to strike against Strahd von Zarovich.

## Properties
- **Type:** Wondrous Item
- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Attunement:** Yes

## Magic
While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the *disguise self* spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.

The *disguise self* spell allows the wearer to make themselves—including clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings—look different. The wearer can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. The wearer can't change their body type, so they must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. If the wearer uses this spell to appear thinner, someone touching them would feel the true form beneath the illusion.

- Allows him to appear as a half-elf rather than his true human form
- Combined with his Ring of Mind Shielding, provides comprehensive protection against detection
- Part of Van Richten's strategy to hide in plain sight while gathering intelligence
