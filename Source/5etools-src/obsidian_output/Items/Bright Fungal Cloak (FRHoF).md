# Bright Fungal Cloak

*Item, None*

While wearing a Bright Fungal Cloak, you can take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to furl or unfurl it. When the cloak is unfurled, it sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 5-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 5 feet.

One pound of fungus is sewn into a Bright Fungal Cloak. This fungus can be eaten as food. Once all the fungus is consumed, the cloak becomes a mundane set of [[Traveler's Clothes|XPHB]].
