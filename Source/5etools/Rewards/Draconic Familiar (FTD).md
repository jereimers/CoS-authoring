# Draconic Familiar

*Draconic Gift*

You gain the aid of a draconic familiar, which might be a splinter of the consciousness of a dragon that invested you with power.

You can cast the [[find familiar]] spell as a ritual without using any material components. When you cast the spell in this way, your familiar always takes the form of a [[pseudodragon]].

Additionally, when you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your pseudodragon familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.
