# Wand of Web

*Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge to cast [[Web|XPHB]] (save DC 13) from it.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `1d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
