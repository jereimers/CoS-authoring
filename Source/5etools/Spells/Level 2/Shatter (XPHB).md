# Shatter

*2nd-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 60 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking **3d8** Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d8` for each spell slot level above 2.
