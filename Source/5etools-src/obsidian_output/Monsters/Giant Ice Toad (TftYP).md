## Traits

**Amphibious.** The toad can breathe air and water.

**Cold Aura.** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the toad takes 5 (**1d10**) cold damage.

**Standing Leap.** The toad's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the toad can't bite another target.

**Swallow.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature the toad is grappling. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) piercing damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and it takes 10 (**3d6**) acid damage and 11 (**2d10**) cold damage at the start of each of the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].
