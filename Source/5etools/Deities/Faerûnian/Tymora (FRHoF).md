# Tymora

**Pantheon:** Faerûnian  
**Alignment:**   
**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** 

Tymora is a bright-faced god of fortune, the patron deity of game players and gamblers. Our Smiling Lady loves those who gamble with skill and daring. She watches over all who take risks to better their fortunes. Tymora takes the form of a tall, graceful young woman with flowing platinum-blond or silver hair. She might send a faerie dragon as an emissary.

Tymora is Beshaba's sister. Long ago, the Netherese revered Tyche, the god of luck, whose influence extended over both good luck and bad. Tyche perished, but Beshaba and Tymora manifested soon after, each commanding half of Tyche's portfolio.

The battle cry of Tymora is "Fortune favors the bold." Folk pray to Tymora before any endeavor in which a little good luck would help. One common method of divining the future is to toss a coin to a stranger and ask if it's heads. If it is, the coin is left with the stranger as payment for Tymora's favor. If it's not, the stranger can keep it (and the bad luck that comes with it) or return it.

Those who favor Tymora—as distinct from those who merely invoke her name whenever they roll dice—are daring sorts. Many of her followers are adventurers and gamblers. They believe that the good in their lives results from having both good luck and the bravery to seek it out. Tymora draws all sorts of worshipers: the dashing noble, the risk-taking merchant, the daydreaming field hand, and the scheming ne'er-do-well.

Priests of Tymora and temples devoted to Lady Luck are scarce, since her faith doesn't stress a need for intermediaries: "Let the lucky man and the Smiling Lady suss it out," as the old saying goes. Shrines to Tymora at gambling parlors aren't unusual, however, and such establishments might attract a priest and effectively become temples.

Tymora's Chosen become infused with her extraordinary luck. Some never realize they are Chosen, ascribing their luck to mere chance. The Smiling Lady chooses individuals who embrace her tenets and dive boldly into action and risk, rolling the dice and betting big.
