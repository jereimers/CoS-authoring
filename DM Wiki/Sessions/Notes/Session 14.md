%% A session is a unit of play in which the players meet in person, enact one or more scenes/encounters, and then adjourn. Sessions have recaps and dates, and can span across boundaries of arc/act. %%

We pick up at Wachterhaus, as dinner with Lady Fiona is about to begin.

>[!note]+ SESSION NOTE
>Since we'll be playing at the bar, I expect the Dinner to take the majority of our time. A fine place to end would be at **The Players Return**, below, when they discover the Blue Water Inn was ransacked. If we reach this point earlier than expected, it's fine to continue into Neyavr 5 with the 3 Options detailed later in this document.

# Neyavr 4, Dinnertime
## Dinner at [[Wachterhaus]]

![[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish#^Profile-Lady-Fiona-Wachter]]
### Drinks in the Parlor

>[!tldr]+ Things Fiona can say to the players
>***Arden:*** Your armor is magnificent, though I'm afraid I don't recognize the sigil on your breastplate... what meaning does it hold?
>
>***Fig:*** I can't say I've ever seen a blade such as that! Where did you acquire such a marvelous instrument? (Can also inquire about the silver dragon pendant)
>
>***Choppy:*** Aren't you a charming young man! However did you come to wield such powerful magics?
>
>***Varnish:*** I find your manner of dress fascinating, Mr. Gothorn, especially those shaded spectacles. Have they served you well here in our shadowed land?

## Return to the [[Blue Water Inn]]

> [!note]+ DM NOTE
>
>Izek has only seen Ireena in the context of the party (never by herself). The party was known to be aiding Father Lucian after the church was damaged, so it wouldn't be weird for them to be repeatedly visiting the church. They are also know to be staying at the Blue Water Inn, so it's fair to say that Izek assumed Ireena would be staying at the inn along with the party (and not at the church, which is obviously not a place at which most people would take up temporary residence). His INT and WIS are also super low (10 and 9, respectively) so he couldn't have thought that hard about it.
### Izek's Visit

![[Arc G - The Strazni Siblings#G1a. Izek’s Visit]]

### The Players Return
![[Arc G - The Strazni Siblings#G1b. The Players Return]]

## The Next Morning (Neyavr 5)

>[!note]+ DM NOTE:
>Ernst reflecting on having had coffee from a Vistana caravan is very funny given that Arden supplied coffee (or maybe ashes) at the [[Tser Pool Encampment|Tser Pool]] on the morning of [[Neyavr 2]] in [[Session 07 - The Tarokka Reading#Leaving Camp]]. 

![[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish#F3. Return to the Blue Water Inn]]


# Neyavr 5, Option 1: Plant the poisoned wine, kill [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] (Arc F)

## Planting the Poinsoned Wine

>[!note]+ DM NOTE
>Have Ernst (or Urwin & Danika) confirm the players' plan before they embark

![[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish#F4a. Planting the Poisoned Wine]]

## Trailing Izek

![[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish#F4b. Trailing Izek]]

## Ambushing Izek (Neyavr 5, Evening)

![[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish#F4c. Ambushing Izek]]
# Neyavr 5, Option 2: Seek out [[Van Richten's Tower|Khazan's Tower]] (Arc E)

## Lake Zarovich (Szoldar & Yevgeni's Hunting Shack)

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E4. Lake Zarovich]]

## The Svalich Road, Luna River Bridge, & Crossroads

>[!note]+ DM NOTE
>Since none of my players have a passive perception this high, ask for a perception check when they leave Szoldar's hunting shack. Keep the DC at 19.
>
>Also, skip the encounter with the Scarecrows and Twig Blights, since we already did that. But do the scrap of material at the bridge.


![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E5. The Svalich Road]]


## Lake Baratok, Ezmerelda's Wagon, The Tower

>[!tip]+ DESCRIPTION OF THE LAKE & TOWER
>You come to a cold mountain lake enclosed by misty woods and rocky bluffs. Thick fog creeps across the dark, still waters. The trail ends at a grass-covered causeway that stretches a hundred yards across the lake to a flat, marshy island with a stone tower on it. The tower is old and decrepit, with collapsing scaffolds clinging to one side where a large gash has split the wall. Timeworn griffon statues, their wings and flanks covered with moss, perch atop buttresses that support the walls. Parked near the base of the tower, within sight of the entrance, is a barrel-topped wagon spattered with mud.
### Ezmerelda's Wagon

>[!tldr]+ DESCRIPTION OF EZMERELDA'S WAGON
> Under layers of mud, this wagon sports a fresh coat of purple paint, and its wheels have fancy gold trim. A brass lantern hangs from each corner, and red drapes cover a tombstone-shaped window on each side. A steel padlock secures the back door, hanging from which are three cheap wooden signs arranged in a haphazard diagonal that read, in order, "Keep out!" "Home & Property of Ezmerelda D'Avenir," and "Trespassers will be immediately incinerated." Beneath the warning on the third sign, someone has drawn a small frowning face with crossed-out eyes, surrounded by a stylized flame.

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E6a. Ezmerelda’s Wagon]]

### The Tower

>[!tldr]+ DESCRIPTION OF THE TOWER DOOR
>The tower door is made of iron, with no visible handles or hinges. In the middle of the door is a large, embossed, blank red seal. Carved into the lintel above the door is a word: Khazan.

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#1. The Tower Door]]

### The Scaffolding
>[!tldr]+ DESCRIPTION OF THE SCAFFOLDING
>Rotting wooden beams support the scaffolding, which groans and creaks with the slightest breeze. A series of ladders and platforms lead to a hole in the northwest wall on the third floor.

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#2. The Scaffolding]]

### Inside the Tower
>[!tldr]+ Description of Tower, First Floor
>The flagstone floor is strewn with debris, and a few old crates stand near the east wall. A torn curtain to the south partially obscures the tower vestibule.  
>A five-foot-square indentation in the center of the floor contains four pulleys attached to taut iron chains that stretch up through a similarly sized hole in the rotted wooden ceiling. Standing next to the chains are four tall clay statues.

>[!tldr]+ Description of Tower, Second Floor
>Dust and cobwebs fill this otherwise empty room, the wooden floor of which is badly rotted and partially collapsed.
>In the middle of the room is a 5 -foot-square hole in the floor and ceiling, with a rusty chain near each corner. The chains are part of the tower's elevator mechanism (see area V4). The 5 -foot-square sections of floor that surround the central shaft are weak. Each 5 -foot section can support **150 pounds**; any more weight causes the section to collapse, and any creatures standing on that section fall 20 feet to the ground floor.

>[!tldr]+ Description of Tower, Third Floor
>Time and the elements have all but destroyed this chamber, leaving a gash in the northwest wall and slimy black mildew on the walls. The wooden floor is completely rotted and has begun to fall away in places. In the southeastern corner stands an old, rotted crib.
>In the middle of the room is a 5 -foot-square hole in the floor and ceiling, with a rusty chain near each corner. The chains are part of the tower's elevator mechanism (see area V4). The 5 -foot-square sections of floor that surround the central shaft are weak. Each 5 -foot section can support **50 pounds**; any more weight causes the section to collapse, and any creatures standing on that section fall 40 feet to the ground floor, smashing through the second floor on the way down.

>[!tldr]+ Description of Tower, Fourth Floor
>Unlike the levels below, this room shows signs of recent habitation, and although the place reeks of mold and mildew, it has plenty of creature comforts, including a cozy bed, a desk with matching chair, bright tapestries, and a large iron stove with plenty of wood to feed it. Light enters through arrow slits as well as through dirtcaked windows with broken shutters. Other features of the room include a standing suit of armor and a wooden chest. Old wooden rafters bend under the weight of the tower roof, which has somehow remained intact. Mounted to the rafters are pulleys around which hang iron chains that support the tower's elevator platform.

## The Road Back

![[Arc E - The Missing Vistana#E7. The Road Back]]

## Return to Vallaki

>[!note]+ Player Options on Return to Vallaki (Arc E - The Missing Vistana)
>When the players return to Vallaki, they can pursue their leads either by seeking out [[Rictavio]] at the [[Blue Water Inn]], or by directly investigating [[Rictavio]]’s wagon in Arasek Stockyard.

>In this portion, remember that the box with Yan's head smells strongly of lavender and that the head has been embalmed using magical oils so that it won't decay and that it will remember its previous conversations had with characters using necromancy.
