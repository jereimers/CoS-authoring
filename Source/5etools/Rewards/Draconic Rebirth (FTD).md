# Draconic Rebirth

*Draconic Gift*

You become a dragonborn. You replace the racial traits of your original race with the traits of a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragonborn (detailed in this [[book|FTD]]). The kind of dragonborn you become matches the family of the dragon that is the source of this gift. You can keep any skill proficiencies you gained from your previous race, or you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.
