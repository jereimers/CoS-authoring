## Traits

**Amphibious.** The triton can breathe air and water.

**Nimble Escape.** The triton can take the Disengage or Hide actions as a bonus action on each of its turns.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The triton makes two urchin-spine shortsword attacks.

**Urchin-Spine Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d6 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) poison damage. If the damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, that creature is stable but [[poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [[paralyzed]] while [[poisoned]] in this way.

**Poisoned Spine.** Ranged Weapon Attack +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) poison damage.
