## Traits

**Virulent Breath.** Noxious gas from the mutate's digestion of previous meals spews from its mouth. At the start of the mutate's turn, each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (**1d6**) poison damage.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The mutate makes two Bite or Tentacle attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Chitin Slam.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (`1d10`) on a failure. On a successful save, the target is no longer [[poisoned]]. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until it no longer has the [[poisoned]] condition.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 15) and the [[restrained]] condition until this grapple ends. The mutate has two tentacles that can grapple one target each.

**Chitin Slam.** The mutate targets one creature it is grappling, slamming the creature against its chitinous plating. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (**3d10**) bludgeoning damage and have the [[stunned]] condition until the end of the mutate's next turn.
