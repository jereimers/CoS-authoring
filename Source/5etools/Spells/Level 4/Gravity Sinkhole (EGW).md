# Gravity Sinkhole

*4th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 120 feet  
**Components:** V, S, M (a black marble)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can see within range and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes **5d10** force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `5d10` for each slot level above 4th.
