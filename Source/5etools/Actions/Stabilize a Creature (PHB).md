# Stabilize a Creature

**Time:** 1 action

You can use your action to administer first aid to an [[unconscious]] creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([[Medicine]]) check.

A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain [[unconscious]]. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after `1d4` hours.
