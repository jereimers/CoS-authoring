# Knife of Stolen Resistance

*Item, Rare*

Using an action, you carve a single infernal rune into the flesh of an [[unconscious]] Beast, Celestial, Dragon, Fey, or Giant with this knife. Over the next 10 minutes the creature dies an agonizing death that can't be prevented short of the [[Wish]] spell. If the creature has any resistances or immunities, you gain those resistances and immunities until the creature dies or a [[Wish]] spell is used to save the creature. The knife's power can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
