# Baba Yaga's Pestle

*Item, Artifact* *(requires attunement)*

The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra **1d8** force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
