# Cloak of Arachnida

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint, silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

## Poison Resistance

You have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Poison damage.

## Spider Climb

You have a [[Climb Speed|XPHB]] equal to your [[Speed|XPHB]] and can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

## Spider Walk

You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were [[Difficult Terrain|XPHB]].

## Web

You can cast [[Web|XPHB]] (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
