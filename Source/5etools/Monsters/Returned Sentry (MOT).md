## Traits

**Pack Tactics.** The Returned has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the Returned's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[incapacitated]].

**Turn Resistance.** The Returned has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

**Unreadable Face.** The Returned is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts. Wisdom ([[Insight]]) checks to ascertain the Returned's intentions or sincerity are made with disadvantage.
