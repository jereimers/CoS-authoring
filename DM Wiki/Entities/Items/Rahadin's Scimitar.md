# Rahadin's Scimitar

## Description
A deadly **scimitar** wielded by [[Rahadin]], the dusk elf chamberlain of [[Castle Ravenloft]] and Strahd's most trusted servant. In Rahadin's hands, this curved blade has ended thousands of lives over nearly five centuries of loyal service to the von Zarovich family.

Though the scimitar itself appears to be a standard weapon, Rahadin's exceptional skill (+6 Dexterity modifier) and centuries of combat experience make it devastatingly effective.

## Properties
- **Type:** Martial Melee Weapon
- **Damage:** 1d6 + 6 slashing
- **Attack Bonus:** +10 to hit
- **Properties:** Finesse, Light
- **Rarity:** Common (mundane weapon)
- **Attunement:** No

## Combat Statistics
As wielded by Rahadin:
- **Attack:** +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target
- **Hit:** 9 (1d6 + 6) slashing damage
- **Multiattack:** Rahadin attacks three times with his scimitar

## The Screams of the Dead
Anyone who comes within 10 feet of Rahadin can hear the howling screams of the countless men and women he has killed with this blade and others like it. This supernatural effect is tied to Rahadin himself, not the weapon—but the scimitar has certainly contributed to the chorus of the damned.

- Rahadin can make three attacks with this weapon per round
