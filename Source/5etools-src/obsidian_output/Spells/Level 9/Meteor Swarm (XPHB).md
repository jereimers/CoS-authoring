# Meteor Swarm

*9th-level evocation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** 1 miles  
**Components:** V, S  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes **20d6** Fire damage and **20d6** Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery [[Sphere [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts [[burning|XPHB]] if it's flammable.
