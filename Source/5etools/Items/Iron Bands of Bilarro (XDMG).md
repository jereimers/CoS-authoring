# Iron Bands of Bilarro

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your [[Proficiency|XPHB]]. On a hit, the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until you take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature that can touch the bands, including the one [[Restrained|XPHB]], can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the [[Restrained|XPHB]] creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.
