## Traits

**Barbed Hide.** At the start of each of its turns, the devil deals 5 (**1d10**) Piercing damage to any creature it is grappling or any creature grappling it.

**Diabolical Restoration.** If the devil dies outside the Nine Hells, its body disappears in sulfurous smoke, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] somewhere in the Nine Hells.

**Magic Resistance.** The devil has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Claws.** m +6, reach 5 ft. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) Piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 13) from both claws.
