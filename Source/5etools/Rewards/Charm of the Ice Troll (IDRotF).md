# Charm of the Ice Troll

*Charm*

*This charm can be bestowed by a {@creature chwinga* living in Icewind Dale or other cold regions by using their Magical Gift action.}

This charm allows you to use your reaction when you take cold damage to reduce the damage to 0. You regain a number of hit points equal to half the cold damage you would have taken. Once you do so, the charm vanishes from you.
