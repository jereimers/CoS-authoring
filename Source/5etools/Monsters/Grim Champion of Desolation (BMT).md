## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the champion fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The champion makes two Leeching Blade attacks and uses Hollow Void.

**Leeching Blade.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d6 + 6**) slashing damage plus 33 (**6d10**) cold damage, and the champion regains 10 hit points.

**Hollow Void.** The champion summons a hungering rift around a creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The creature must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 49 (**11d8**) force damage and has the [[stunned]] condition until the start of the champion's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by this effect, the creature dies, and its body crumbles to dust.


## Bonus Actions

**Step into Nothing {@recharge 4}.** The champion, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, has the [[invisible]] condition and teleports to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of itself. The champion remains [[invisible]] until the start of its next turn or immediately after it deals damage.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Crush.** The champion unleashes a burst of crushing force on a creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) force damage and have the [[prone]] condition.

**Fearsome Pursuit.** The champion moves up to its speed or commands its mount to move up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

**Nullify (Costs 2 Actions).** The champion emits a magic wave in a 60-foot cone. Every spell of 5th level or lower ends on creatures and objects of the champion's choice in that area.
