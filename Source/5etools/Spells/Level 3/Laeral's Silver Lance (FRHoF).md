Silver energy bursts out from you in a 120-foot-long, 5-foot-wide [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature of your choice in the [[Line [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **3d10** Force damage and has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

The damage increases by `3d10` for every spell slot level above 3.
