An aura radiates from you in a 30-foot [[Emanation [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] for the duration. While in the aura, you and your allies have [[Resistance|XPHB]] to Necrotic damage, and your [[Hit Points|XPHB]] maximums can't be reduced. If an ally with 0 [[Hit Points|XPHB]] starts its turn in the aura, that ally regains 1 [[Hit Points|XPHB]].
