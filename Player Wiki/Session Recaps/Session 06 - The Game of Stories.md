## Arrival at [[Tser Pool Encampment|Tser Pool]] and [[Vistani]] Camp


The heroes, en route to [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] to deliver [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to [[St. Andral's Church]], settled down for the evening among a small group of [[Vistani]] at the [[Tser Pool Encampment|Tser Pool]]. This calm body of water is located along the Tser River, downriver from [[Tser Falls|the falls]]. 

## [[Madam Eva]]'s Warning and the Approaching Shadow


During a brief meeting in her tent, the [[Vistani]] seer [[Madam Eva]] stressed the severity of the party's quest, informing them that countless others who attempted it met a terminal fate. She agreed to perform a Tarokka reading but postponed it, cautioning that "a shadow is approaching my tent; a lone servant of Darkness who seeks knowledge of your future."


## [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]], [[Eliza]], and the Game of Stories


Upon leaving the tent, the party met two [[Vistani]] travelers: the dark and brooding [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] (with a faint whiff of undeath) and the friendly, inviting [[Eliza]]. [[Stanimir]], the encampment's "papa," invited the party to join them for dinner and to play the Game of Stories. The rules required each player to share a short tale (for a small wager) to make others laugh or cry. After each telling, others would claim the story was false, true, or half-true. The player with the most correct claims would win the pot.


## Tales Told Around the Campfire


The crew ate mutton stew and Barovian wine as the tales were shared:

- [[Stanimir's Tale]]: The true story of a noble prince wounded in battle, nursed back to health by [[Vistani]], and in return, he promised them free passage and safe haven in his lands. The prince was revealed to be [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Count Strahd]], centuries ago.
    
- [[Choppy Gibbles|Choppy]]'s Tale: The true story of his silver-tongued con man uncle who learned that lies build nothing lasting after being trapped by a flood in the fake bridge scheme he tricked a town into funding.
    
- [[Eliza's Tale]]: The half-true legend of Lugdana, [[the Morninglord]]’s champion, who fell banishing the demon Chernovog at Yester Hill. Her holy symbol was reclaimed by ravens, but the fate of the powerful talisman, the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]], remains unknown.
    
- [[Arden Nalero|Arden]]'s Tale: His origins as the lone Drow survivor of a family slain by Lolth’s assassins, dedicating centuries to serving Hoar, god of vengeance, as a relentless instrument of justice.
    
- [[Parriwimple]]'s Tale: A hilariously tragic tale of being terrorized by a vicious one-eyed chicken named Old Murderbeak, who outwitted and bloodied him until the bird was finally cooked.
    
- [[Fig Fleetfoot|Fig]]'s Tale: The story of Jack Lop the Clever, a Harengon trickster who won a dangerous wager with the wicked Lord Blackwood by impersonating his wife’s voice to make him abolish his cruel taxes.
    
- [[Arturi's Tale]]: A cycle of vengeance initiated by a grieving Fox's attempt to heal a dying Sparrow chick, leading to the annihilation of the Sparrows by Rats.
    
- [[Varnish Gothorn|Varnish]]'s Tale: A lonely craftsman falls in love with a ghostly spirit who promises to be his bride if he builds her a carriage, but he is cursed to join a spectral procession of undead brides when he disobeys her warning on their wedding night.
    
- [[Ireena's Tale]]: A harrowing, true encounter with a monstrous wolf that emerged from the fog during a lakeside outing, chasing him into the woods until he blacked out, only to awaken safely at home.

## Aftermath and Departure

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] was the winner of the game and redistributed some of the wagered items. [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] explained that he is cursed to be hunted by undead each night and must spend the evening hiding in a large tree for the sake of his new friends' safety. The players successfully evaded the 'shadow' alluded to by [[Madam Eva]] and swiftly arrived at the Tser [[River Ivlis Crossroads|Crossroads]] unhindered, their agreed-upon meeting place and a familiar site of the [[DM Wiki/Entities/NPCs/Strahd von Zarovich|Devil Strahd]]'s first encounter with the party.
