# Midnight Tears

*Item, None*

A creature that ingests Midnight Tears suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. Any effect that ends the [[Poisoned|XPHB]] condition neutralizes this poison. If the poison hasn't been neutralized before midnight, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (**9d6**) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
