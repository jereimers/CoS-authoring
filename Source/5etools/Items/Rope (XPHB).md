# Rope

*Item, None*

As a [[Utilize|XPHB]] action, you can tie a knot with Rope if you succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([[Sleight of Hand|XPHB]]) check. The Rope can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check.

You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope only if the creature has the [[Grappled|XPHB]], [[Incapacitated|XPHB]], or [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the creature to make a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([[Acrobatics|XPHB]]) check as an action.
