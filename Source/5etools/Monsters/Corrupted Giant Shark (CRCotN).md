## Traits

**Psychic Maelstrom.** Any creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the shark must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 11 (**2d10**) psychic damage.

**Regeneration.** The shark regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the shark takes radiant damage or suffers a critical hit, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The shark dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

**Water Breathing.** The shark can breathe only underwater.


## Actions

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit (with advantage if the target is a creature missing any hit points), reach 5 ft., one target. @h22 (**3d10 + 6**) piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]].
