## Traits

**Freeze.** If the elemental takes Cold damage, its [[Speed|XPHB]] decreases by 20 feet until the end of its next turn.

**Water Form.** The elemental can enter an enemy's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** m +7, reach 5 ft. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Prone|XPHB]] condition.

**Whelm {@recharge 4}.** str DC 15, each creature in the elemental's space. @actSaveFail 22 (**4d8 + 4**) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled|XPHB]] condition (escape DC 14). Until the grapple ends, the target has the [[Restrained|XPHB]] condition, is suffocating unless it can breathe water, and takes 9 (**2d8**) Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the elemental's turns. The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at a time with Whelm. As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature out of it by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength ([[Athletics|XPHB]]) check. @actSaveSuccess Half damage only.
