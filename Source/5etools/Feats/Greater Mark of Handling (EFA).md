# Greater Mark of Handling

**Prerequisites:** Level 4

You gain the following benefits.

## Improved Intuition

When you use the Wild Intuition benefit of your [[Mark of Handling|EFA]] feat, you can roll `1d6` instead of `1d4`.

## Improved Handling

While you are mounted, immediately after you hit a target within 5 feet of your mount with a melee attack roll, your mount can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to move up to its [[Speed|XPHB]] or take the [[Attack|XPHB]] action to make one attack only (your choice).

## Subdue Animal

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you exert command over one Beast or Monstrosity you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and [[Proficiency|XPHB]]) or have the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition until the start of your next turn. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency|XPHB]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]].
