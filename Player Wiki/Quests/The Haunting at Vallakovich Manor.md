# Objective

Investigate the haunting *discreetly*.

# What the Party knows

- For the past two months, a spirit has haunted the Vallakovich mansion. 
* Servants have seen its reflection in mirrors or darkened windows, and have reported cold drafts, strange sounds, and objects that move of their own volition.
* The mansion’s butler and the baroness' lady-in-waiting have already left [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]]'s employment, too fearful of the ghost to continue working in the house.
* [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]’s wife, Baroness Lydia Petrovna, hosts daily lunches for a group of Vallakian women, who [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] uses to prepare costumes and decorations for his weekly festivals. [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] is desperate to ensure that the women remain ignorant of the spirit’s existence.
* [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s cook, a doughty woman named Tereska, has seen the spirit most recently, and nearly quit her job before [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|the Baron]] convinced her to stay by (reluctantly) increasing her pay.

# Leads

- Talk to [[Tereska]] in the kitchen of the [[DM Wiki/Entities/Areas/Town of Vallaki/Burgomaster's Mansion|Vallakovich Manor]]

# Outcome

**Quest Complete**

The party discovered the source of the haunting in [[Session 13 - The Lost and The Found|Session 13]]. After being visited by the ghost of [[Erasmus]] (who wrote "Help Victor" in frost), the party met [[Victor Vallakovich]] in his father's library and followed him to his attic workroom.

There, Victor revealed the truth: the "haunting" was caused by [[Stella Wachter]]'s disembodied soul. Two months ago, Victor and Stella attempted to create a teleportation circle to escape Barovia. The experiment catastrophically failed, severing Stella's soul from her body and trapping it in the Ethereal Plane. Her ghostly presence—desperately trying to communicate or find help—manifested as the paranormal activity throughout the manor.

Erasmus van Richten's poltergeist has been protecting Stella's soul from dark entities in the Ethereal Plane, but she is slowly fading. This revelation led directly to the quest [[The Lost Soul]].
