# Rictavio's Ring of Mind Shielding

## Description
This **ring of mind shielding** is worn by [[Rudolph van Richten]], the legendary vampire hunter operating in Barovia under the alias "Rictavio." The ring protects his thoughts from magical intrusion, preventing Strahd or his agents from reading his mind and discovering his true identity or intentions.

This ring works in concert with his [[Rictavio's Hat of Disguise|hat of disguise]] to provide comprehensive protection—the hat conceals his physical appearance while the ring shields his thoughts.

## Properties
- **Type:** Ring
- **Rarity:** Uncommon
- **Attunement:** Yes

## Magic
While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.

You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.

If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it.

## Notes
- Critical protection against Strahd's *detect thoughts* spell and similar abilities
- Prevents Strahd's spies from magically confirming Van Richten's identity
- Combined with the Hat of Disguise, allows Van Richten to maintain his Rictavio persona indefinitely
- Essential for surviving in a domain controlled by a powerful vampire wizard
