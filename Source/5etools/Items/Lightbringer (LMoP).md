# Lightbringer

*Item, Uncommon*

This +1 mace was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a [[torch|phb]] when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra **1d6** radiant damage to undead creatures.
