# Siren Song Lyre

*Wondrous Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

You can use an action to play this lyre and cast one of the following spells from it: [[animal friendship]], [[charm person]], [[enthrall]], [[suggestion]]. If the spell requires a saving throw, the spell save DC is 13.

Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
