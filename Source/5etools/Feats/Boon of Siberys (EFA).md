# Boon of Siberys

**Prerequisites:** Level 19

You gain the following benefits.

## Aberrant Magic

Choose a level 8 or lower spell from the Sorcerer spell list or a spell from the Siberys Dragonmark Spells table (the table includes dragonmark suggestions if you'd like to associate a spell with one of the marks). You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot or spell components, and you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]]. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell (choose when you gain this feat).
