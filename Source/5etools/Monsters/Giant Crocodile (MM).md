## Traits

**Hold Breath.** The crocodile can hold its breath for 30 minutes.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The crocodile makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h21 (**3d10 + 5**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the crocodile can't bite another target.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target not [[grappled]] by the crocodile. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
