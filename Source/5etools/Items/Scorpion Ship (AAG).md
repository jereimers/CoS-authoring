# Scorpion Ship

*Item, None*

Scorpion ships are archaic metal warships that have never lost their popularity, largely because of their versatility. Articulated legs enable a scorpion ship to land safely on the ground and move across a solid surface at a walking speed of 30 feet. The ship can't float on water, however. A ballista is mounted on the top deck, and a mangonel is perched on the end of the tail. The ship's two claws are relatively inefficient in combat, but a claw that grabs a creature can quickly take it out of action.
