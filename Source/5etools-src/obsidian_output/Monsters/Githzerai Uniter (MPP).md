## Traits

**Psychic Defense.** While the githzerai is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The githzerai makes three Unarmed Strike or Psychic Bolt attacks. It can replace any of these attacks with one use of its Pacifying Touch.

**Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**1d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage.

**Psychic Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +6 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. @h17 (**5d6**) psychic damage.

**Pacifying Touch.** The githzerai touches one creature it can see within 5 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw, or the githzerai chooses an action for that target: Attack, Cast a Spell, or Dash. The affected target can't take that action for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save. A target that succeeds on the saving throw becomes immune to this githzerai's Pacifying Touch for 24 hours.
