# Icon of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms

This [[haunted traps|VRGR]] is tied to the 10-foot-radius sphere surrounding an ominous, 1-foot-tall statue of a menacing, four-winged, birdlike figure. Once per day, when a creature enters the area, the trap's emanation manifests as the sound of distant flapping wings and a rush of warm air. If that creature is still in the area at the start of its next turn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [[charmed]] and [[incapacitated]] for 1 minute. These conditions last until the creature is damaged or someone else uses an action to shake the creature. If the affected creature remains [[charmed]] for the full minute, they are then affected as per the spell [[magic jar]], their soul entering the statue and being replaced by the spirit of a disembodied fiend. This effect ends when [[dispel evil and good]] or a similar spell is cast on the affected creature, or when the statue is destroyed. The statue has AC 17, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

This haunted trap manifests as the result of a fiendish influence. Casting [[dispel evil and good]] on the statue permanently disarms the haunted trap.
