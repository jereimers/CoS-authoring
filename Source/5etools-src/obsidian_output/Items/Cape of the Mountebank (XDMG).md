# Cape of the Mountebank

*Wondrous Item, Rare*

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast [[Dimension Door|XPHB]] as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is [[Lightly Obscured|XPHB]] by that smoke until the end of your next turn.
