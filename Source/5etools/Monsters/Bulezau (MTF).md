## Traits

**Rotting Presence.** When any creature that isn't a demon starts its turn within 30 feet one or more bulezaus, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take `1d6` necrotic damage plus 1 necrotic damage for each bulezau within 30 feet of it.

**Standing Leap.** The bulezau's long jump is up to 20 feet and its high jump is up to 10 feet, with or without a running start.

**Sure-Footed.** The bulezau has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [[prone]].


## Actions

**Barbed Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h8 (**1d12 + 2**) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [[poisoned]] until the disease ends. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the target sports festering boils, coughs up flies, and sheds rotting skin, and the target must repeat the saving throw after every 24 hours that elapse. On a successful save, the disease ends. On a failed save, the target's hit point maximum is reduced by 4 (`1d8`). The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
