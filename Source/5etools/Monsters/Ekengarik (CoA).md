## Traits

**Hive Mind.** All fiendish formians within 1 mile of Ekengarik can telepathically communicate with each other and Ekengarik.

**Regeneration.** Ekengarik regenerates 10 hit points at the start of her turn, unless she took radiant damage in the last round.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ekengarik makes three Bite attacks. She can replace one of the attacks with an Acid Spray (if available) attack or a use of Spellcasting.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's Strength score is reduced by 2 (`1d4`). The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

**Acid Spray {@recharge 5}.** Ekengarik spits acid at one creature within 60 feet of her, or two creatures within 60 feet of her and 5 feet of each other. Targets must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (**6d10**) acid damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.



## Reactions

**Hardened Carapace {@recharge 4}.** When hit with an attack, Ekengarik temporarily hardens her carapace, reducing her speed to 0 and increasing her AC by 5 until the start of her next turn.
