# Thieves' Cant

**Type:** Secret  
**Script:** None  
**Typical Speakers:** {@creature assassin||assassins}, {@class rogue||rogues}

Thieves' cant is a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows messages to be hidden in seemingly normal conversation. Only a creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
