# Stone Shape

*4th-level transmutation*

---

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

---

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape you like. For example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, statue, or coffer, or you could make a small passage through a wall that is 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
