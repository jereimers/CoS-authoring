# Cauldron of Rebirth

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare* *(requires attunement by a druid or warlock)*

This Tiny pot bears relief scenes of heroes on its cast-iron sides.

You can use the cauldron as a [[Spellcasting Focus|XPHB]] for your spells, and it functions as a suitable component for the [[Scrying|XPHB]] spell.

## Brew Potion

When you finish a [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you can use the cauldron to create a [[Potion of Greater Healing|XDMG]], which takes 1 minute. The potion lasts for 24 hours, then loses its magic if not consumed.

## Raise Dead

As a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, you can cause the cauldron to grow large enough for a Medium creature to crouch within. You can revert the cauldron to its normal size as a [[Magic|XPHB]] action, harmlessly shunting anything that can't fit inside to the nearest unoccupied space.

If you place the corpse of a Humanoid into the cauldron and cover the corpse with 200 pounds of salt (which costs 10 GP) for at least 8 hours, the salt is consumed and the creature returns to life as if by [[Raise Dead|XPHB]] at the next dawn. Once used, this property can't be used again for 7 days.
