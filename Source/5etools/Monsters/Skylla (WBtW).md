## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Skylla carries an [[Eldritch Staff|WBtW]] (see appendix A) with 10 charges. The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a `d20`; on a 1, the staff is destroyed.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Skylla makes two Eldritch Staff attacks. She can replace one of the attacks with a use of Spellcasting.

**Eldritch Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage, or 4 (**1d8**) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands, and Skylla can expend up to 3 of the staff's charges, dealing an extra 4 (**1d8**) lightning damage for each expended charge.



## Reactions

**Eldritch Escape.** When Skylla takes damage, she can expend 3 charges of her eldritch staff to turn [[invisible]] and teleport, along with any equipment she's wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see. She remains [[invisible]] until the start of her next turn or until she attacks or casts a spell.
