## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The ram has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Ram.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h9 (**2d4 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (**1d6**) force damage. If the ram moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or have the [[prone]] condition.

**Force Bolt.** Ranged Spell Attack +4 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. @h7 (**2d6**) force damage.



## Reactions

**Absorbent Fleece {@recharge}.** Immediately after the ram succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or a spell's attack misses it, the ram can make one Force Bolt attack.
