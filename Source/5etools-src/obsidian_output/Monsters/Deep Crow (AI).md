## Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The deep crow has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Shadow Stealth.** While in dim light or darkness, the deep crow can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the deep crow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

**Mandibles.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]], and the deep crow can't use its mandibles on another target.
