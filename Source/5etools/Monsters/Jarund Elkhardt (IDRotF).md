## Traits

**Brute.** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when Jarund hits with it (included in the attack).

**Multiattack.** Jarund makes three melee attacks.

**Warhammer.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h13 (**2d8 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, or 15 (**2d10 + 4**) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands.

**Shield.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage, and Jarund pushes the target 5 feet away from him if it's Large or smaller.
