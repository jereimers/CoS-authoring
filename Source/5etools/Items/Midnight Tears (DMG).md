# Midnight Tears

*Item, None*

A creature that ingests this poison suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (**9d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
