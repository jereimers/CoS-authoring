## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the spider fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Spider Climb.** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Walker.** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The spider makes two Bite attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with a use of Web Bomb.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. @h19 (**2d10 + 8**) piercing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) poison damage.

**Web Bomb.** Ranged Weapon Attack +14 to hit, range 300 ft./600 ft., one target. @h24 (**3d10 + 8**) bludgeoning damage, and the target and all creatures within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) acid damage and have the [[restrained]] condition until the start of the spider's next turn.



## Reactions

**Absorb Blow.** In response to being hit with an attack roll, the spider's carapace absorbs some of the blow, reducing the damage it takes by 11 (`2d10`).
