## Traits

**Bramble Walk.** Difficult terrain composed of vegetation, such as foliage or thorns, doesn't cost the dryad extra movement.

**Magic Resistance.** The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Speak with Beasts and Plants.** The dryad can communicate with Beasts and Plants as if they shared a language.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dryad makes two Poisonous Thorn attacks and one Sapping Vine attack.

**Poisonous Thorn.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. @h13 (**4d4 + 3**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[poisoned]] condition until the start of the dryad's next turn.

**Sapping Vine.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @hThe target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 16). Until the grapple ends, the target has the [[restrained]] condition, and the dryad can't use the same vine on another target. A creature [[restrained]] in this way takes 13 (**3d8**) necrotic damage at the start of its turn.

The dryad has six vines. Each vine can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a vine deals no damage to the dryad, but any creature [[grappled]] by that vine no longer has the [[grappled]] condition. All vines immediately wither and disappear when the dryad is reduced to 0 hit points.
