## Traits

**Amphibious.** The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**Mucous Cloud.** While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by a cloud of sticky mucus. A creature that touches the aboleth or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be [[restrained]] until the end of the aboleth's next turn.

**Probing Telepathy.** If a creature the aboleth can see communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the creature's greatest desires.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The aboleth makes two Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (**1d6**) psychic damage.

**Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h14 (**2d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Enslave {@recharge 4}.** The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [[charmed]] by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The [[charmed]] target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.

The [[charmed]] target can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage, ending the effect on itself on a success. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.



## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Tail Swipe.** The aboleth makes one Tail attack.

**Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions).** One creature [[charmed]] by the aboleth takes 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.
