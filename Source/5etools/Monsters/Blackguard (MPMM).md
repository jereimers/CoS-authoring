## Actions

**Multiattack.** The blackguard makes three attacks, using Glaive, Shortbow, or both.

**Glaive.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h9 (**1d10 + 4**) slashing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) necrotic damage.

**Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) piercing damage.

**Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** Each enemy within 30 feet of the blackguard must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] of the blackguard for 1 minute. If a [[frightened]] target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the blackguard, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.


## Bonus Actions

**Smite.** Immediately after the blackguard hits a target with an attack roll, the blackguard can force that target to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers one of the following effects of the blackguard's choice:

**Blind.** The target is [[blinded]] for 1 minute. The [[blinded]] target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Shove.** The target is pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked [[prone]].
