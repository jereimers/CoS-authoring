## Traits

**Fallible Invisibility.** The skulk is [[invisible]]. This invisibility can be circumvented by three things:

- The skulk appears as a drab, smooth-skinned humanoid if its reflection can be seen in a mirror or on another surface.
- The skulk appears as a dim, translucent form in the light of a candle made of fat rendered from a corpse whose identity is unknown.
- Humanoid children, aged 10 and under, can see through this invisibility.

**Trackless.** The skulk leaves no tracks to indicate where it has been or where it's headed.


## Actions

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h6 (**1d4 + 4**) slashing damage. If the skulk has advantage on the attack roll, the target also takes 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage.
