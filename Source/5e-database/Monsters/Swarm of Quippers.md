## Special Abilities

**Blood Frenzy.** The swarm has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny quipper. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

**Water Breathing.** The swarm can breathe only underwater.


## Actions

**Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 14 (4d6) piercing damage, or 7 (2d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
