## Actions

**Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d6 + 2**) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (**4d6**) radiant damage.

**Corona of Beauty.** Naes activates an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until he dismisses it using an action. He emits bright light in a 60-foot-radius and dim light 30 feet beyond that. His enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.

**Radiant Beauty of Sune {@recharge 4}.** Naes dispels any magical darkness within 30 feet of him. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of Naes that does not have Cover must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 60 radiant damage on a failed saving throw, half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw has the [[blinded]] condition for 1 minute.



## Reactions

**Hard to Kill (1/Day).** If Naes would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, or is subjected to an effect that would kill him instantaneously without doing damage, Naes instead drops to 1 hit point.
