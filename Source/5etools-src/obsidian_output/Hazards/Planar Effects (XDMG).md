# Planar Effects

Certain planes of existence—and areas on the Material Plane affected by them—have supernatural effects on creatures within them. Several examples are presented below. See [[chapter 6|XDMG]] for more information about the planes of existence.

## Acheronian Bloodlust

The plane of [[Acheron|XDMG]] rewards a creature for harming other creatures by imbuing it with the strength to keep fighting. While in Acheron or a region under its influence, a creature gains [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to half its Hit Point maximum whenever it reduces another creature to 0 Hit Points.

## Arcadian Vitality

On the plane of [[Arcadia|XDMG]] and in regions where its influence is felt, creatures benefit from supernatural vitality, which grants them [[Immunity|XPHB]] the [[Frightened|XPHB]] and [[Poisoned|XPHB]] conditions.

## Blessed Beneficence

On the plane of [[Mount Celestia|XDMG]] and in regions where its influence is felt, creatures are blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures other than Fiends and Undead gain the benefit of the [[Bless|XPHB]] spell as long as they remain in an area of blessed beneficence. In addition, such a creature that finishes a Long Rest in the area gains the benefit of a [[Lesser Restoration|XPHB]] spell.

## Gehennan Cruelty

On the plane of [[Gehenna|XDMG]] and in regions where its influence is felt, creatures are driven to loathe helping one another. Whenever a creature subject to Gehennan cruelty casts a spell, including a spell that restores Hit Points or removes a condition other than [[Invisible|XPHB]], the caster must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, or the spell fails and is wasted.

## Winds of Pandemonium

The winds of [[Pandemonium|XDMG]] are common in Pandemonium and regions where its influence is felt, including parts of the Underdark. A creature makes a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level. The winds can't increase a creature's [[Exhaustion|XPHB]] level above 3. Finishing a Long Rest doesn't reduce a creature's Exhaustion level unless the creature can somehow escape the winds.
