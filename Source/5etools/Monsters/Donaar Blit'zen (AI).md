## Traits

**Champion Challenge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** As a bonus action, Donaar causes each creature of his choice that he can see within 30 feet of him to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature can't willingly move more than 30 feet away from Donaar. This effect ends on the creature if Donaar is [[incapacitated]] or dies, or if the creature is moved more than 30 feet away from him.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Donaar makes two attacks with his greatsword or his whip.

**Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h10 (**2d6 + 3**) slashing damage. Whenever Donaar rolls a 1 or 2 on a damage die, he can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d4 + 3**) slashing damage.

**Acid Vomit.** Donaar regurgitates acid in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (**2d6**) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
