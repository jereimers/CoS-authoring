# Monster Camouflage

*Item, None*

A suit of Monster Camouflage looks like a Beast or Monstrosity, such as an [[owlbear|XMM]]. To discern that you're disguised, a creature must take the [[Study|XPHB]] action to inspect your appearance and succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence ([[Investigation|XPHB]] or [[Nature|XPHB]]) check. The creature has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on this check if it is within 30 feet of you and automatically succeeds on this check if you do anything the monster you're disguised as couldn't do.
