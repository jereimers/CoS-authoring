## Traits

**Entropic Aura.** Each creature that is not a construct or undead that ends its turn within 15 feet of Ygorl takes 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Ygorl fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Ygorl has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Ygorl makes three attacks: two with its scythe, and one with its Entropic Touch.

**Scythe.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. @h18 (**2d10 + 7**) slashing damage plus 19 (**3d12**) necrotic damage. Any creature reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies, with its body and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, exploding into a cloud of ash. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [[wish]] spell.

**Entropic Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d8 + 7**) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [[exhaustion]].

**Summon Slaadi (1/Day).** Ygorl summons `1d4 + 1` [[death slaad|]]. A summoned slaad appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Ygorl, acts as an ally of Ygorl, and can't summon other slaadi. It remains for 1 minute, until it or Ygorl dies, or until Ygorl dismisses it as an action.

**Teleport.** Ygorl teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Scythe.** Ygorl makes one attack with its scythe.

**Teleport.** Ygorl uses its Teleport action.

**Call the Void (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature that is not a construct or undead within 30 feet of Ygorl must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw against the lord of entropy's attempt to unmake life, taking 42 (**12d6**) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Ygorl then regains a number of hit points equal to half the total damage taken by all affected creatures.
