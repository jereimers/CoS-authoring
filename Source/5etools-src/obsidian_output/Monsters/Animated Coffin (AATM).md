## Traits

**False Appearance.** If the animated coffin is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the coffin move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to discern that the coffin is animate.

**Spider Climb.** The animated coffin can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The animated coffin makes two Slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d8 + 3**) bludgeoning damage.

**Entrap.** Melee Weapon Attack +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. @hThe target has the [[grappled]] condition (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, if the target is not an Undead, the target has the [[restrained]] condition and takes 14 (**4d6**) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The animated coffin can grapple only one creature at a time.
