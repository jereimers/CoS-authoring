## Traits

**Ice Walk.** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h15 (**2d10 + 4**) piercing damage plus 4 (**1d8**) cold damage.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h11 (**2d6 + 4**) slashing damage.

**Cold Breath {@recharge 5}.** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (**10d8**) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
