## Traits

**Diabolical Restoration.** If the devil dies outside the Nine Hells, its body disappears in sulfurous smoke, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]] somewhere in the Nine Hells.

**Magic Resistance.** The devil has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The devil makes three attacks, using Searing Fork or Hurl Flame in any combination. It can replace one attack with a use of Infernal Tail.

**Searing Fork.** m +10, reach 10 ft. @h15 (**2d8 + 6**) Piercing damage plus 9 (**2d8**) Fire damage.

**Hurl Flame.** r +8, range 150 ft. @h26 (**5d8 + 4**) Fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it starts [[burning|XPHB]].

**Infernal Tail.** dex DC 17, one creature the devil can see within 10 feet. @actSaveFail 10 (**1d8 + 6**) Necrotic damage, and the target receives an infernal wound if it doesn't have one. While wounded, the target loses 10 (`3d6`) [[Hit Points|XPHB]] at the start of each of its turns. The wound closes after 1 minute, after a spell restores [[Hit Points|XPHB]] to the target, or after the target or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to stanch the wound, doing so by succeeding on a DC 17 Wisdom ([[Medicine|XPHB]]) check.
