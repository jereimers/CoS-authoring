# Drow High Magic

**Prerequisites:** elf

You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the [[detect magic]] spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn [[levitate]] and [[dispel magic]], each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
