# Preeminent in House

When you request a favor from your house (as decribed under "[[Favored in House|EFA]]"), it can take one of the following additional forms:

- A dragonmarked member of the house casts for you a level 5 spell associated with the house's mark at no cost.
- A member of the house casts for you a different spell of level 8 or lower at half the usual cost.

In addition, your house stipend increases to support your Aristocratic lifestyle (10 GP per day).
