# Tyro of the Gauntlet

You gain the following benefits.

## Stand as One

When an ally within 5 feet of you is subjected to an effect that would push or pull it, you can take a [[Reaction|XPHB]] to prevent that ally from being pushed or pulled. To receive this benefit, the ally can't have the [[Incapacitated|XPHB]] condition.

## Vigilant

When you take the [[Ready|XPHB]] action, the next attack roll made against you has [[Disadvantage|XPHB]] before the start of your next turn.
