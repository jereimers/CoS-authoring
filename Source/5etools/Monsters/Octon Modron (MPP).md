## Traits

**Axiomatic Mind.** The octon can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

**Combat Ready.** The octon has advantage on initiative checks.

**Disintegration.** If the octon dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind anything it was carrying.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The octon makes three Tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. @h14 (**3d6 + 4**) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (**2d8**) lightning damage.

**Whirlwind of Tentacles {@recharge 5}.** The octon rapidly extends and spins its ring of tentacles. Each creature within 20 feet of the octon must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 10 feet in a straight line toward the octon. Then, the octon makes two Tentacle attacks against each creature within 10 feet of itself.
