# Helm of Telepathy

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon* *(requires attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast [[Detect Thoughts|XPHB]] or [[Suggestion|XPHB]] (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
