# Chislev

**Pantheon:** Dragonlance

**Domains:** Unknown  
**Symbol:** Feather

Chislev is the god of nature on its own terms, governing the rhythms of life that unfold heedless of mortal action.

Chislev's followers are often hermits, druids, and others who revere nature without asking anything in return.
