## Traits

**Flyby.** The peryton doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

**Keen Sight and Smell.** The peryton has advantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight or smell.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the peryton fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The peryton makes two attacks: one with its gore and one with its talons.

**Gore.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h12 (**2d6 + 5**) piercing damage.

**Talons.** Melee Weapon Attack +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) slashing damage.

**Warp Shadow.** The peryton chooses up to three creatures within 60 feet of it that it can see. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. While cursed, whenever the creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a `d4` and subtract that number from the roll. A cursed creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this peryton's Warp Shadow for 24 hours.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Detect.** The peryton makes a Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check.

**Talons Attack.** The peryton makes one attack with its talons.

**Dive Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The peryton moves up to its speed toward one target of its choosing. It then makes a gore attack that deals an extra 9 (**2d8**) piercing damage on a hit.
