## Traits

**Chardalyn Sense.** Zlan senses the emotions of anyone touching a piece of chardalyn within 100 miles of itself.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Zlan fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** Zlan has [[Advantage|XPHB]] on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Next of the Seven (6/Year).** If Zlan dies within 100 miles of a piece of chardalyn at least 4 inches long, it re-forms from that piece of chardalyn in `1d10` days, regaining all its [[Hit Points|XPHB]]. The new body appears in the unoccupied space nearest to the piece of chardalyn, and another lich's mind in the body seizes psychic control of the body.
