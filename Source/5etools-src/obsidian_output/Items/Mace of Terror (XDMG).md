# Mace of Terror

*Item, Rare* *(requires attunement)*

This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[Frightened|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. While [[Frightened|XPHB]] in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't make [[Opportunity Attack|XPHB]]. For its action, it can use only the [[Dash|XPHB]] action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the [[Dodge|XPHB]] action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
