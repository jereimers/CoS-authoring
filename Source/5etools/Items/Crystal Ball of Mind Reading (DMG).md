# Crystal Ball of Mind Reading

*Wondrous Item, Legendary* *(requires attunement)*

This [[crystal ball]] is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [[scrying]] spell (save DC 17) with it.

You can use an action to cast the [[detect thoughts]] spell (save DC 17) while you are [[scrying]] with the [[crystal ball]], targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [[detect thoughts]] to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [[scrying]] ends.
