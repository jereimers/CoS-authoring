## Traits

**Special Equipment.** Laeral wears a white [[robe of the archmagi]] (accounted for in her statistics). She wields a [[flame tongue longsword]].

**Magic Resistance.** While wearing her robe of the archmagi, Laeral has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Laeral makes three attacks with her silver hair and flame tongue, in any combination. She can cast one of her cantrips or 1st-level spells before or after making these attacks.

**Silver Hair.** Melee Weapon Attack +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h7 (**2d6**) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be [[paralyzed]] for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Flame Tongue.** Melee Weapon Attack +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h5 (**1d8 + 1**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) fire damage, or 6 (**1d10 + 1**) slashing damage plus 7 (**2d6**) fire damage when used with two hands.

**Spellfire (Recharges after a Long Rest).** Magical, heatless, silver fire harmlessly erupts from Laeral and surrounds her until she is [[incapacitated]] or until she uses an action to quench it. She gains one of the following benefits of her choice, which lasts until the silver fire ends:

- She can breathe underwater.
- She can survive without food and water.
- She is immune to magic that would ascertain her thoughts, truthfulness, alignment, or creature type.
- She gains resistance to cold damage, and she is unharmed by temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit.

While the silver fire is present, she has the following additional action options:

- Cast the [[cure wounds]] spell. The target regains `1d8 + 5` hit points. After Laeral takes this action, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1, the silver fire disappears.
- Cast the [[revivify]] spell without material components. After Laeral takes this action, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1-2, the silver fire disappears.
- Release a 60-foot line of silver fire that is 5 feet wide or a 30-foot cone of silver fire. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take 26 (**4d12**) fire damage. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 26 (**4d12**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After Laeral takes this action, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1-3, the silver fire disappears.
