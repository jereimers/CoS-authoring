## Traits

**Avoidance.** If the star angler is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails.

**Illumination.** The star angler's lure sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The star angler makes three Bite attacks.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h16 (**2d10 + 5**) piercing damage.


## Bonus Actions

**Lure Charm.** The star angler's lure flares with enchanting starlight, targeting one creature the star angler can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[charmed]] condition until the start of the star angler's next turn. While [[charmed]] in this way, the target has the [[incapacitated]] condition and must use its movement on its turn to move directly toward the star angler; a [[charmed]] target doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but it does avoid damaging terrain. A target can be [[charmed]] by only one star angler at a time.
