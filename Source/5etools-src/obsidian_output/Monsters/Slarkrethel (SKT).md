## Traits

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Slarkrethel fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Amphibious.** Slarkrethel can breathe air and water.

**Freedom of Movement.** Slarkrethel ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be [[restrained]]. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being [[grappled]].

**Siege Monster.** Slarkrethel deals double damage to objects and structures.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** Slarkrethel makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h23 (**3d8 + 10**) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature [[grappled]] by Slarkrethel, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is [[blinded]] and [[restrained]], it has Cover against attacks and other effects outside Slarkrethel, and it takes 42 (**12d6**) acid damage at the start of each of Slarkrethel's turns. If Slarkrethel takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, Slarkrethel must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [[prone]] in a space within 10 feet of Slarkrethel. If Slarkrethel dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [[restrained]] by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting [[prone]].

**Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. @h20 (**3d6 + 10**) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[restrained]]. Slarkrethel has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling.** One Large or smaller object held or creature [[grappled]] by Slarkrethel is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked [[prone]]. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [[prone]].

**Lightning Storm.** Slarkrethel magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target Slarkrethel can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.




## Legendary Actions

The creature can take 3 legendary actions.

**Tentacle Attack or Fling.** Slarkrethel makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.

**Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).** Slarkrethel uses Lightning Storm.

**Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).** While underwater, Slarkrethel expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than Slarkrethel. Each creature other than Slarkrethel that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (**3d10**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of Slarkrethel's next turn.
