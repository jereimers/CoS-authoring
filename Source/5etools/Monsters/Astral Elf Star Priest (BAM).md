## Traits

**Fey Ancestry.** The elf has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid or end the [[charmed]] condition on itself, and magic can't put it to sleep.

**Unusual Nature.** The elf doesn't require sleep.


## Actions

**Multiattack.** The elf makes two Morningstar attacks. It can use Rain of Radiance in place of one of these attacks.

**Morningstar.** Melee Weapon Attack +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. @h4 (**1d8**) piercing damage plus 17 (**5d6**) radiant damage.

**Rain of Radiance.** Magical, flame-like radiance rains down on a creature that the elf can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**5d8**) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


## Bonus Actions

**Starlight Step (2/Day).** The elf magically teleports up to 30 feet, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see.
