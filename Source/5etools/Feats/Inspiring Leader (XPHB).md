# Inspiring Leader

**Prerequisites:** Level 4, WIS 13+, Level 4, CHA 13+

You gain the following benefits.

## Bolstering Performance

When you finish a [[Short Rest|XPHB]] or [[Long Rest|XPHB]], you can give an inspiring performance: a speech, song, or dance. When you do so, choose up to six allies (which can include yourself) within 30 feet of yourself who witness the performance. The chosen creatures each gain [[Temporary Hit Points|XPHB]] equal to your character level plus the modifier of the ability you increased with this feat.
