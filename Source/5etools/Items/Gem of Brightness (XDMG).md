# Gem of Brightness

*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can take a [[Magic|XPHB]] action and use one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

- **First Command Word:** The gem sheds [[Bright Light|XPHB]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Dim Light|XPHB]] for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a [[Bonus Action|XPHB]] to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.
- **Second Command Word:** You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Blinded|XPHB]] condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Third Command Word:** You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]]. Each creature in the [[Cone [Area of Effect]|XPHB]] makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.
